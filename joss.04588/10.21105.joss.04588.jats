  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The increase of available data has had a positive impact on the
  entire sports domain and especially sport science
  (<xref alt="Morgulev et al., 2018" rid="ref-Morgulev2018" ref-type="bibr">Morgulev
  et al., 2018</xref>). Two major data sources of relevance in this
  domain are spatiotemporal tracking data of athlete positions as well
  as manually annotated match event data
  (<xref alt="Memmert &amp; Raabe, 2018" rid="ref-Memmert2018" ref-type="bibr">Memmert
  &amp; Raabe, 2018</xref>;
  <xref alt="Stein et al., 2017" rid="ref-Stein2017" ref-type="bibr">Stein
  et al., 2017</xref>). These two data types are regularly collected by
  professional sport organizations in different team invasion games such
  as football, basketball, or handball
  (<xref alt="Memmert, 2021" rid="ref-Memmert2021" ref-type="bibr">Memmert,
  2021</xref>). These data sources open up a whole range of new analysis
  possibilities across multiple (sub)disciplines in the field, including
  match and performance analysis, exercise physiology, training science,
  or collective movement behavior analysis. As an example, player
  tracking data has been used extensively to analyze physical
  (<xref alt="Castellano et al., 2014" rid="ref-Castellano2014" ref-type="bibr">Castellano
  et al., 2014</xref>) as well as tactical
  (<xref alt="Rein &amp; Memmert, 2016" rid="ref-Rein2016" ref-type="bibr">Rein
  &amp; Memmert, 2016</xref>) performance in football.</p>
  <p>The <italic>floodlight</italic> Python package provides a framework
  to support and automate team sport data analysis.
  <italic>floodlight</italic> is constructed to process spatiotemporal
  tracking data, event data, and other game meta-information to support
  scientific performance analyses. <italic>floodlight</italic> was
  designed to provide a general yet flexible approach to performance
  analysis, while simultaneously providing a user-friendly high-level
  interface for users with basic programming skills. The package
  includes routines for most aspects of the data analysis process,
  including dedicated data classes, file parsing functionality, public
  dataset APIs, pre-processing routines, common data models and several
  standard analysis algorithms previously used in the literature, as
  well as basic visualization functionality.</p>

  <p>Central to the package is a set of generalized, provider- and
  sports-independent core data structures based on
  <italic>NumPy</italic>
  (<xref alt="Harris et al., 2020" rid="ref-Harris2020" ref-type="bibr">Harris
  et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>pandas</italic>
  (<xref alt="McKinney, 2010" rid="ref-McKinney2010" ref-type="bibr">McKinney,
  2010</xref>). Each of these data structures are dedicated to one
  specific type of sports data, including spatiotemporal tracking data,
  event data, game codes (meta information such as ball possession
  information), pitch information regarding the embedding of data and
  playing surfaces into Cartesian coordinate systems, as well as team
  and player properties (such as frame-wise velocity or acceleration
  values). The data structures are designed with a focus on scientific
  computing, i.e., optimized for accessible and intuitive data
  manipulations as well as sensitive to performance by utilizing
  <italic>NumPy</italic>’s view-, vectorization- and indexing
  techniques.</p>
  <p>The core data classes allow internal storage and processing of
  sports data whilst decoupling from any format-specific requirements.
  Consequently, <italic>floodlight</italic> is built around these
  objects, comprising several elementary modules of the data processing
  pipeline. For data loading, the package provides parsing submodules
  with functions that dissect and map data from specific provider
  formats to core data structures (including providers such as Kinexon,
  Tracab, Stats Perform, StatsBomb, Second Spectrum, Opta, or DFL),
  which eliminates problems caused by the many, strongly varying data
  formats in use. Data loaders and mappers for available public datasets
  such as the EIGD-H dataset
  (<xref alt="Biermann et al., 2021" rid="ref-Biermann2021" ref-type="bibr">Biermann
  et al., 2021</xref>) are additionally included. In terms of data
  processing, the package provides dedicated manipulation functionality
  such as spatial transformations helpful for spatial data
  synchronization or signal filters based on <italic>SciPy</italic>
  (<xref alt="Virtanen et al., 2020" rid="ref-Virtanen2020" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen
  et al., 2020</xref>). For data inspection, basic visualization
  functionality based on the <italic>Matplotlib</italic> package
  (<xref alt="Hunter, 2007" rid="ref-Hunter2007" ref-type="bibr">Hunter,
  2007</xref>) is included (see
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Asample">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
  <p>The actual data analysis part is realized by a submodule providing
  several data models. These models provide a toolbox of domain-specific
  data analysis procedures from different subdomains such as exercise
  physiology, e.g., the metabolic power model
  (<xref alt="di Prampero &amp; Osgnach, 2018" rid="ref-diPrampero2018" ref-type="bibr">di
  Prampero &amp; Osgnach, 2018</xref>), dynamical system approaches,
  e.g., approximate entropy
  (<xref alt="Pincus, 1991" rid="ref-Pincus1991" ref-type="bibr">Pincus,
  1991</xref>), or collective tactical behavior, e.g., centroid-based
  measures
  (<xref alt="Bourbousson et al., 2010" rid="ref-Bourbousson2010" ref-type="bibr">Bourbousson
  et al., 2010</xref>;
  <xref alt="Sampaio &amp; Maçãs, 2012" rid="ref-Sampaio2012" ref-type="bibr">Sampaio
  &amp; Maçãs, 2012</xref>). All models follow the same syntax inspired
  by the <italic>scikit-learn</italic> package
  (<xref alt="Buitinck et al., 2013" rid="ref-Buitinck2013" ref-type="bibr">Buitinck
  et al., 2013</xref>), where upon instantiation, a central fitting
  method is called with core data structures. Subsequently, required
  computations can be queried with additional class methods. This allows
  a consistent syntax and collection of similar measures into cohesive
  data models while limiting the repetition of basic calculations and
  allowing simple future extensions.</p>
  <p>The following code sample illustrates how
  <italic>floodlight</italic> reduces a typical performance analysis
  pipeline to just a few lines of code. In the example, one sample of
  data is queried from the public EIGD-H dataset, filtered, and the
  cumulative metabolic work of the home team is calculated for the
  entire segment of data:</p>
  <preformat>from floodlight.io.datasets import EIGDDataset
from floodlight.transforms.filter import butterworth_lowpass
from floodlight.models.kinetics import MetabolicPowerModel

dataset = EIGDDataset()
home_team_data, away_team_data, ball_data = dataset.get()

home_team_data = butterworth_lowpass(home_team_data)

model = MetabolicPowerModel()
model.fit(home_team_data)
metabolic_power = model.cumulative_metabolic_power()</preformat>
  <p>These lines of code create a new core object named
  <monospace>metabolic_power</monospace>, which contains an array of
  shape (<italic>T</italic> x <italic>N</italic>) storing (cumulated)
  metabolic power values (in joule per kilogram) for each of the
  <italic>T</italic> time points and <italic>N</italic> players. For
  example, we can print the total metabolic work of the seven active
  players:</p>
  <preformat>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(metabolic_power[-1, 0:7])

[1669.18781115 1536.22481121 1461.03243489 1488.61249785  773.09264071

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Despite the increase in volume, the technical requirements for team
  sport data analysis have constantly remained high. This can be
  partially attributed to the complexity and heterogeneity of the data
  itself
  (<xref alt="Memmert &amp; Raabe, 2018" rid="ref-Memmert2018" ref-type="bibr">Memmert
  &amp; Raabe, 2018</xref>;
  <xref alt="Stein et al., 2017" rid="ref-Stein2017" ref-type="bibr">Stein
  et al., 2017</xref>), but also to multiple practical and theoretical
  challenges. These include the necessity of complex file parsing
  procedures for provider-specific data formats, low compatibility
  across data providers, or differing standards for spatial or temporal
  resolution of data, often requiring specialized pre-processing
  routines. Meeting these challenges typically requires massive and
  customized overhead programming in sports data analysis projects. At
  the same time, there hardly exist any general, proprietary or open
  source, software alternatives which can be used out of the box for
  scientific purposes. Existing software is either commercially driven
  (i.e., proprietary, limited to a specific data provider or focused on
  industrial applications), or task-specific (i.e., limited to a certain
  data source, data format, sport or subtask) which leaves the problem
  of adapting code to multiple different APIs within the analysis
  process.</p>
  <p>These current constraints resulted in a situation where a typical
  analysis workflow requires the (re)implementation of each processing
  pipeline module in its entirety with respect to the specific project’s
  needs. For sport scientists who typically lack programming skills
  (which are usually not part of their formal training) this can become
  an insurmountable hurdle. As a consequence, advanced team sports data
  analyses remain inaccessible for large parts of the sport scientific
  community which poses a significant hindrance for future progress.
  Accordingly, the <italic>floodlight</italic> package was designed to
  specifically address this problem and significantly ease advanced
  analyses of sports data. <italic>floodlight</italic> automates
  standard data processing routines and provides a high-level interface
  accessible to users with just basic programming skills. The
  <italic>floodlight</italic> documentation contains several tutorials
  as well as an extensive compendium discussing the technical aspects of
  team sports data analysis to ensure easy access and understanding of
  the routines and their design choices. The tutorials increase the
  beginner-friendliness of <italic>floodlight</italic> and allow its
  usage in educational settings, e.g., for team sport data analytics
  courses.</p>
  <p>Another hurdle faced by sports scientists relates to the current
  lack of collaboration and code sharing practices within the field. At
  present, sharing proposed data models or algorithms for analyses is
  the exception rather than the rule. In parts, the lack of sharing
  often stems from the proprietary nature of the raw data, but is
  further exacerbated by lack of data format gold standards. More
  generally, disciplines that employ team sports data analysis have
  reported a culture that contains very little replications and works
  incorporating previous findings
  (<xref alt="Herold et al., 2019" rid="ref-Herold2019" ref-type="bibr">Herold
  et al., 2019</xref>), low applicability of research by practitioners
  (<xref alt="Bishop, 2008" rid="ref-Bishop2008" ref-type="bibr">Bishop,
  2008</xref>;
  <xref alt="Herold et al., 2019" rid="ref-Herold2019" ref-type="bibr">Herold
  et al., 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Mackenzie &amp; Cushion, 2013" rid="ref-Mackenzie2013" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie
  &amp; Cushion, 2013</xref>) and limited interdisciplinary approaches
  between computer and sport scientists
  (<xref alt="Goes et al., 2021" rid="ref-Goes2021" ref-type="bibr">Goes
  et al., 2021</xref>;
  <xref alt="Rein &amp; Memmert, 2016" rid="ref-Rein2016" ref-type="bibr">Rein
  &amp; Memmert, 2016</xref>). A major milestone in the process of
  meeting these challenges is to find feasible ways of sharing data and
  algorithms
  (<xref alt="Rein &amp; Memmert, 2016" rid="ref-Rein2016" ref-type="bibr">Rein
  &amp; Memmert, 2016</xref>). The <italic>floodlight</italic> package
  can be seen as a first step in this direction with a toolbox-approach
  collecting common data manipulation and processing techniques.</p>
  <p><italic>floodlight</italic> will therefore be equally useful for
  sports scientists as well as computer scientists, working in academia
  or applied settings. The package will therefore serve to bring these
  users groups together and foster future interdisciplinary
  collaborations. Ideally, this will also promote further open source
  contributions that share advanced data processing algorithms in the
  domain and enable future work incorporating previous findings.</p>
