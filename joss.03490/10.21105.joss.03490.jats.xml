  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Kinematic analysis studies characterize human motion in healthy,
  pathologic, and rehabilitated subjects. These studies provide rich
  datasets which enable clinicians and researchers to understand disease
  progression, and the effects of surgical intervention and physical
  therapy. A variety of techniques – ranging from optical skin marker
  tracking to biplane fluoroscopy – are utilized to collect these
  datasets. The quantification and physical interpretation of these
  motion capture datasets (i.e. kinematic analysis) are predominantly
  conducted using Euler/Cardan angles
  (<xref alt="Diebel, 2006" rid="ref-DiebelU003A2006" ref-type="bibr">Diebel,
  2006</xref>;

  <xref alt="Zatsiorsky, 1998" rid="ref-ZatsiorskyU003A1998" ref-type="bibr">Zatsiorsky,

  peer-reviewed manuscripts in 2D graphs
  (<xref alt="Ludewig et al., 2009" rid="ref-LudewigU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Ludewig
  et al., 2009</xref>). This rudimentary presentation, however, obscures
  the physical meaning behind Euler/Cardan analysis. As other authors
  have noted, the visualization of these angles enables meaningful
  discussion between biomechanics researchers and clinicians
  (<xref alt="Baker, 2011" rid="ref-BakerU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Baker,
  2011</xref>). A ubiquitous open-source method to concurrently
  visualize recorded human motion and the results of kinematic analysis
  is presently lacking in the biomechanics community. ‘Kinematics-vis’
  is a JavaScript web application that visualizes kinematic analysis
  output resulting from motion capture studies.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>3D rotations are utilized to quantify human motion and in kinematic
  analysis. However, because 3D rotations belong to the SO(3)
  mathematical group, they can be difficult to understand – especially
  for biomechanics researchers and clinicians with a limited
  mathematical background. Euler/Cardan angles are typically utilized to
  infuse physical meaning into kinematic analysis
  (<xref alt="Diebel, 2006" rid="ref-DiebelU003A2006" ref-type="bibr">Diebel,
  2006</xref>;
  <xref alt="Wikipedia, 2021" rid="ref-WikipediaU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">Wikipedia,
  2021</xref>;
  <xref alt="Zatsiorsky, 1998" rid="ref-ZatsiorskyU003A1998" ref-type="bibr">Zatsiorsky,
  1998</xref>). However, they are described abstractly and attempts
  towards visualizing their physical underpinning is rarely made
  (<xref alt="Baker, 2011" rid="ref-BakerU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Baker,
  2011</xref>). Furthermore, 12 Euler/Cardan angle sequences exist for
  quantifying 3D orientations, and which sequence is most appropriate
  for quantifying human motion is debatable and varies by study
  (<xref alt="Krishnan et al., 2019" rid="ref-KrishnanU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan
  et al., 2019</xref>). It has previously been shown that incorrect
  usage of Euler/Cardan sequences can significantly misrepresent human
  motion
  (<xref alt="Aliaj et al., 2021" rid="ref-AliajU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">Aliaj
  et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, studies rarely present multiple
  Euler/Cardan sequences in publications – which clouds data
  interpretation and limits the ability to compare results between
  laboratory groups and studies.</p>
  <p>‘Kinematics-vis’ is a JavaScript web application that visualizes
  different methods of quantifying and decomposing human motion
  including, but not limited to, Euler/Cardan angles
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Afig1">Figure 1</xref>. The software
  enables researchers to visualize different kinematic analysis methods
  while outputting the 2D time-series graphs that are typically
  presented in peer-reviewed manuscripts
  (<xref alt="Ludewig et al., 2009" rid="ref-LudewigU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Ludewig
  et al., 2009</xref>). Presently, ‘kinematics-vis’ is specialized to
  study shoulder kinematic analysis. However, it is easily expandable to
  accommodate the decomposition sequences of other joints, including
  subject-specific 3D anatomic models. ‘Kinematics-vis’ is designed to
  work from a central motion capture dataset, but also enables the
  visualization of singular motion files. JavaScript and WebGL, the
  technologies which underlie ‘kinematics-vis’, are ubiquitous and a
  standard in modern web browsers – which facilitates collaboration
  between researchers and clinicians.</p>
  <p>A variety of commercial musculoskeletal modeling software are
  utilized in biomechanics, including
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anybodytech.com/">AnyBody</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="AnyBodyTech, 2020" rid="ref-AnyBodyU003A2020" ref-type="bibr">AnyBodyTech,
  2020</xref>) and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.c-motion.com/#visual3d">Visual3D</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="CMotion, 2021" rid="ref-Visual3DU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">CMotion,
  2021</xref>). Computational kinematics packages (e.g. rotation
  matrices, trajectory generation, quaternions) are abundant and are
  typically provided as part of scientific computing environments –
  e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.transform.html">SciPy
  Spatial Transform package</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="SciPy-Developers, 2021" rid="ref-SciPyU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">SciPy-Developers,
  2021</xref>) – but, visualization software is scarce. The open-source
  musculoskeletal modeling software
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opensim.stanford.edu/work/index.html">OpenSim</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="Delp et al., 2007" rid="ref-DelpU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Delp
  et al., 2007</xref>) does provide the ability to visualize the
  movement of bones and joints. However, what is missing from all the
  aforementioned software is the ability to visualize how decomposition
  methods (particularly Euler/Cardan angles) quantify human motion.
  Because 12 Euler/Cardan angle sequences exist, the choice of such a
  sequence can have a meaningful effect on the kinematic plots presented
  in biomechanics studies to researchers and clinicians
  (<xref alt="Aliaj et al., 2021" rid="ref-AliajU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">Aliaj
  et al., 2021</xref>;
  <xref alt="Baker, 2011" rid="ref-BakerU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Baker,
  2011</xref>). Notably,
  (<xref alt="Baker, 2011" rid="ref-BakerU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Baker,
  2011</xref>) visually demonstrates how the measured joint angles are
  affected by the chosen Euler/Cardan angle sequence and argues that
  “only when we can adequately visualise these angles that we can engage
  in meaningful consideration of which orientation this is.” Although
  (<xref alt="Baker, 2011" rid="ref-BakerU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Baker,
  2011</xref>) represents the first attempt at visualizing these angles
  in biomechanics literature, the presented analysis is static. It
  consists of a series of screenshots in a journal article.</p>
  <p>The solution presented herein enables biomechanics researchers to
  visualize the 3D angles that Euler/Cardan decompositions quantify, and
  to associate these 3D angles with typical 2D plots. The interactive
  nature of the software also enables exploration that is not possible
  within the confines of a journal article page. The presented software
  can be especially useful to novice biomechanics researchers
  (e.g. undergraduate and graduate students) for learning kinematic
  analysis. The downside of the presented software is that it offers
  only kinematic analysis within the musculoskeletal modeling and
  analysis domain. Perhaps a better approach is to include this software
  as a plug-in to
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opensim.stanford.edu/work/index.html">OpenSim</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="Delp et al., 2007" rid="ref-DelpU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Delp
  et al., 2007</xref>). The downside of the plug-in approach is that
  researchers that perform kinematic analysis may not perform subsequent
  modeling. Regardless, it would be a good idea to consider whether
  future iterations of this software should be developed as a plug-in to
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opensim.stanford.edu/work/index.html">OpenSim</ext-link>
  (<xref alt="Delp et al., 2007" rid="ref-DelpU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Delp
  et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
  <p>Human motion analysis is a complex topic. Biomechanists,
  clinicians, and trainees typically accept the results of research
  papers without having a consistent way to validate these results.
  ‘Kinematics-vis’ enables discussion amongst all parties interested in
  human motion analysis and obviates the need for a significant
  mathematical background. ‘Kinematics-vis’ provides a means for
  researchers to make their motion capture datasets visually explorable.
  This provides insight which is missing in the 2D graphs accompanying
  peer-reviewed publications. This software can be used as an adjunct to
  published manuscripts to allow readers to analyze a motion of interest
  both visually and quantitatively.</p>

  <title>Mathematics</title>
  <p>Minimally, kinematic analysis in biomechanics can be thought of as
  three steps:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p>Establishing an orthogonal coordinate system associated with
      each bone of interest via bony landmarks.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Tracking the position and orientation (pose) of the bones of
      interest with respect to each other and/or an external coordinate
      system of interest.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Quantifying the position and orientation of the bones of
      interest by utilizing various decomposition techniques. For
      example, orientation is frequently decomposed via a specific
      Euler/Cardan sequence.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Each of these three steps can be accomplished in a variety of ways.
  In order to standardize these steps and increase reproducibility
  between biomechanics laboratories, the International Society of
  Biomechanics (ISB) has issued guidelines via a series of journal
  articles
  (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2005" rid="ref-WuU003A2005" ref-type="bibr">Wu
  et al., 2005</xref>). However, there is still debate on whether these
  guidelines are appropriate for all investigations
  (<xref alt="Phadke et al., 2011" rid="ref-PhadkeU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Phadke
  et al., 2011</xref>). The excellent review article by
  (<xref alt="Krishnan et al., 2019" rid="ref-KrishnanU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan
  et al., 2019</xref>) provides an overview of the multitude of
  functional kinematic representations of the shoulder joint and
  provides a succinct introduction to the underlying mathematics.</p>
  <p>The mathematical representation of orientation (3D rotations) can
  be difficult to understand because 3D rotations are unintuitive for
  most biomechanics researchers. Finite 3D rotations cannot be added and
  do not commute - therefore they do not form a vector space but belong
  to the mathematical group termed SO(3). Typically, long bone axial
  orientation/rotation is the kinematic component that is subject to the
  most debate and misunderstanding
  (<xref alt="Cheng et al., 2000" rid="ref-ChengU003A2000" ref-type="bibr">Cheng
  et al., 2000</xref>;

  presented software, we demonstrated how to correctly measure axial
  rotation for long bones
