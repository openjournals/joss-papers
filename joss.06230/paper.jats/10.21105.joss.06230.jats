  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>It is common in science to have multiple hypotheses that could
  describe your data. Each one of these hypothesis provides a
  mathematical description of the data and gives unique physical insight
  into the data. However, it is not always obvious which hypothesis is
  the correct one and to demonstrate this Figure
  <xref alt="[fig_peaks]" rid="fig_peaks">[fig_peaks]</xref> show Quasi
  Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) data fitted with one and two
  Lorentzian peaks. The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://quickbayes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><monospace>quickBayes</monospace></ext-link>
  package is designed to make it easier for users to determine which
  hypothesis is correct given their data. At present there are example
  workflows for:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Determining the number of Lorentzians in quasielastic neutron
      scattering data.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Determining the number of exponential decays in MuSR (muon
      spectroscopy) data.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>The <monospace>quickBayes</monospace> package comes with an API
  that can be easily be extended by users to calculate the most likely
  hypothesis given their data.</p>

    the loglikelihood calculation the most likely number of peaks is
    two. <styled-content id="fig_peaks"></styled-content></p></caption>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The <monospace>quickBayes</monospace> package started as a
  replacement for the <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> package
  (<xref alt="Sivia &amp; Howells, 2023" rid="ref-quasielasticbayes" ref-type="bibr">Sivia
  &amp; Howells, 2023</xref>), which was used for:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Determining the most likely number of Lorentzians in QENS
      data.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Calculating the loglikelihood of a stretched exponential in
      QENS data.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Calculating a contour of the probability of a stretched
      exponential as a function of beta and sigma (full width half
      maxima).</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>The <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> package is highly
  successful within the field of QENS
  (<xref alt="Sivia et al., 1992" rid="ref-bayesPaper" ref-type="bibr">Sivia
  et al., 1992</xref>). During the development of
  <monospace>quickBayes</monospace> it became clear that the fundamental
  concept would benefit other areas of research such as MuSR and was
  written to be easily extendable into new domains. The new code is
  written in Python with clear sections for fitting functions, fitting
  engines and workflows. The workflows are designed to use the fitting
  functions and engines as building blocks, allowing the workflow to
  focus on the specific steps of the data analysis (e.g., splines,
  rebinning). The code has been developed to make it easy to read and
  understand, with comprehensive automated testing of the functionality.
  These changes make the new code more maintainable and reliable, while
  ensuring it is easily extendable by the user community. In previous
  iterations of the quickBayes and quasielasticbayes packages, the term
  loglikelihood was used as shorthand to describe the natural logarithm
  of the marginal likelihood or model evidence.</p>
  <p>Traditionally the calculation of the marginal likelihood for a
  model, also known as the evidence, is not analytic and needs to be
  done with Bayesian inference. These are computationally expensive
  methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo
  (<xref alt="von Toussaint, 2011" rid="ref-bayesReview" ref-type="bibr">von
  Toussaint, 2011</xref>) or Nested Sampling
  (<xref alt="Skilling, 2006" rid="ref-Skilling" ref-type="bibr">Skilling,
  2006</xref>). Simpler and far less computationally demanding methods
  for model comparison exist, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion
  or Akaike Information Criterion. These use the maximum likelihood and
  some basic information theory to prevent over-fitting by incorporating
  a penalty for more complex models. The packages
  <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> and
  <monospace>quickBayes</monospace> attempt to provide a middle ground
  by using a more robust Bayesian approach, while maintaining a fast
  analytical expression for the evidence
  (<xref alt="Sivia &amp; Skilling, 2006" rid="ref-bayesBook" ref-type="bibr">Sivia
  &amp; Skilling, 2006</xref>). These simple assumptions reduce the
  computational cost significantly allowing users to quickly determine
  the most likely hypothesis given their data. In the QENS community it
  is difficult to determine if the data contains one or two Lorentzians,
  the <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> and now
  <monospace>quickBayes</monospace> packages provide a way to quickly
  calculate which is more likely.</p>
  <p>The <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> package was written in
  Fortran and had become almost impossible to maintain due to poor code
  quality and a lack of unit testing. Furthermore, compiling the package
  only worked in very specific cases due to floats being frequently
  converted between real and complex variables when passed between
  functions. Therefore, a new code was required that captured the key
  functionality of the <monospace>quasielasticbayes</monospace> package
  and led to the development of <monospace>quickBayes</monospace>.</p>
