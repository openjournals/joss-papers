  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Driving simulators are complex pieces of equipment that are
  extremely valuable in experimental studies on driving behavior.
  Simulation technology is very useful in experimentation when doing
  something in real life is either too dangerous or too expensive. In
  driving studies, especially for crash-imminent and driver distraction
  scenarios, the necessary experimental conditions are often both of
  these things.</p>
  <p>The Python package <italic>Pydre</italic> (pronounced pie-dray),
  described in this document, provides a cohesive framework for data
  reduction in the context of real-time, physical driving simulation
  systems that are used to investigate driving behavior. This software
  package is intended to be broadly useful for all driving simulation
  researchers that process data from such mixed and virtual reality
  driving simulators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The driving simulators commonly used for the investigation of
  driving behavior generate a moderate amount of time series data
  (recorded at 30Hz or more) for each scenario run on the sim.
  Investigators often want to convert that time series data to discrete
  objective metrics that describe a specific aspect of how the driver
  interacted with the vehicle during the drive. These metrics need to be
  calculated for all participants in a study, and often for multiple
  scenarios per participant. In this context, we describe the process of
  converting raw data to a meaningful set of discrete metrics as “data
  reduction.”</p>
  <p>Reducing the raw data from driving simulation experiments has been
  a task required for the statistical analysis of those experiments for
  some time
  (<xref alt="Michelle L Reyes &amp; John D Lee, 2011" rid="ref-michellelreyesSimulatorData2011" ref-type="bibr">Michelle
  L Reyes &amp; John D Lee, 2011</xref>). Many different individual
  metrics have been developed over the years as variables of
  investigatory interest
  (<xref alt="McManus et al., 2024" rid="ref-mcmanusPrincipalComponents2024" ref-type="bibr">McManus
  et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
  <p>Other researchers have proposed data reduction software packages.
  Loab et al. describe a Matlab toolkit that performs data reduction
  (<xref alt="Loeb et al., 2014" rid="ref-loebSimulatedDriving2014" ref-type="bibr">Loeb
  et al., 2014</xref>). The notion of “blocks” in that work is directly
  tied to the architecture of a previous version of SimCreator
  (<xref alt="SimCreator, 2024" rid="ref-SimCreator" ref-type="bibr"><italic>SimCreator</italic>,
  2024</xref>), making it less universal. Pawar et al. describe a
  framework of data reduction similar to Pydre, with regions of interest
  and metrics
  (<xref alt="Pawar et al., 2020" rid="ref-pawarDataReduction2020" ref-type="bibr">Pawar
  et al., 2020</xref>). However, it lacks the extensible filter system.
  Neither of these packages are available online in a ready-to-use,
  runnable form, and both are described in a way that focuses on a
  specific experimental scenario.</p>
  <p>This data reduction is a necessary component of the most common
  type of driving-data based analysis of participant simulator
  performance. This work could be accomplished by bespoke processing
  scripts for a particular project. However, these one-off scripts are
  often not taken seriously as reusable code and can lead to fragile
  software projects that can not be easily shared between researchers,
  even at the same lab. In addition, many approaches using multi-stage
  processing with multiple programs can lead to intermediate data files
  and data pipelines that can lead to running code on the incorrect
  “stage” of the data.</p>
  <p>Pydre attempts to avoid the problems above by offering a unified,
  modular architecture for reducing data from driving simulators into
  discrete metrics. It is a single application, designed to be used by
  all projects and share code among them. The modularity allows
  different users to add new filters or metric-calculating functions in
  a separate Python file and eventually test and document that code,
  incorporating it into the general library and allowing easy use for
  other studies. This modularity and universality is a key goal of the
  Pydre package and basic functionality is intended to be used with no
  computer science expertise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="architecture">
  <title>Architecture</title>
  <p>In using Pydre to perform data reduction, researchers write a
  project file describing the data filters, regions of interest (ROIs),
  and metric functions that will be applied. Filters are applied
  sequentially to the raw data, then the augmented data files are
  divided into different ROIs. Finally, metric functions are applied on
  each ROI, resulting in an output data file that contains one row per
  ROI in each original drive data file (see
  <xref alt="[fig:data_flow]" rid="figU003Adata_flow">[fig:data_flow]</xref>).</p>

    <caption><p>Pydre data pipeline. Data files are filtered
    individually, broken up in to regions of interest, then metrics are
    processed for each region.

  </fig>
  <sec id="raw-data-files">
    <title>Raw data files</title>
    <p>The raw data files are the output of the driving simulator. They
    are typically in a tabular format, such as CSV or TSV, and contain
    time-series data for each participant in the study. Each row in the
    data file represents a single time step in the simulation, and each
    column represents a different variable, such as vehicle speed,
    steering wheel angle, or roadway position, as exported. Each
    individual data file contains all the data for a single participant
    driving a single scenario.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="data-filters">
    <title>Data filters</title>
    <p>Data filters augment a raw data file from the sim with additional
    or changed data. They perform tasks such as merging external data or
    converting binary marker columns into sequential numbers for ease of
    later processing. They can also be used to turn raw eye tracking
    data into fixation numbers.</p>
    <p>These filters fulfill the role of data pre-processing in other
    workflows, but with the Pydre architecture, this is all done in
    memory with no intermediate files.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="regions-of-interest">
    <title>Regions of interest</title>
    <p>Regions of interest (ROIs) are partitions of the driving data.
    This is especially useful in repeated-measures experiments, but is
    also important in removing irrelevant parts of the driving scenario
    or focusing in on a critical event in the roadway. Two ROI types
    currently implemented are column ROIs, where the data is partitioned
    based on flags in the data, often set by scenario scripts or manual
    switches toggled during the scenario run. Bounding regions, or
    spatial ROIs, constrain metrics to be calculated in specific regions
    of the roadway. This can be useful when calculating metrics for a
    crosswalk zone, a construction zone or any other zone that is
    constrained in physical space.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="metric-functions">
    <title>Metric functions</title>
    <p>Metric functions are those that output the traditional values
    used to evaluate driving performance in simulation and real-world
    driving. This includes mean speed, standard deviation of speed,
    standard deviation of lateral position, steering reversal rate and
    time above speed limit. The API of metrics provides a standard
    interface for all items, making it easier for researchers to write
    new metric functions and reuse metrics in flexible ways.</p>
    <p>Metrics are the final output of the data reduction process. They
    are calculated for each ROI in each data file, and the results are
    written to a CSV. These metrics files are suitable for loading
    directly into statistical analysis software and computing ANOVAs or
    other methods to compare values between conditions or groups. For
    example, if the ROIs designate the time performing two different
    tasks (task 1 is ROI 1 and task 2 is ROI 2) and a metric output from
    Pydre is standard deviation of lateral position, then the output
    file contains all the information needed to perform a paired t-test
    to compare the standard deviation of lateral position between the
    two tasks.</p>
  </sec>

<sec id="extensibility">
  <title>Extensibility</title>
  <p>Although there are various real-time interactive driving simulation
  software systems in use in academic and industry settings, they use
  very similar tabular, CSV-like, time-series data formats. Pydre was
  built to ingest data formatted like the output of SimObserver
  (<xref alt="SimObserver, 2024" rid="ref-SimObserver" ref-type="bibr"><italic>SimObserver</italic>,
  2024</xref>) (a data recorder from Realtime Technologies), but this is
  a simple TSV interchange data format. Expansion to other driving
  simulator data formats is ongoing.</p>
