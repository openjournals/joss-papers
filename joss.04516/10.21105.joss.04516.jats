  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The electrical power distribution system is under constant
  development and multiple changes will occur in the upcoming years.
  Through the integration of new technology such as Renewable Energy
  Resources (RES) and flexible resources such as microgrids, battery
  energy storage systems, and electrical vehicles, the distribution
  system becomes more active where bidirectional power flow is possible.
  In an active distribution system, utilization and control of the
  different sources are possible. Additionally, the system becomes
  smarter through the integration of Information and Communication
  Technology (ICT) where intelligent monitoring, automated control, and
  communication are possible. These changes increase the complexity of
  the distribution network and new dependencies and interdependencies in
  the system arise with the modernization of the system.</p>
  <p>The traditional reliability analysis methods for power systems do
  not consider the new components and technology, and the behavior and
  impact these have on the distribution network. Therefore, new
  considerations need to be taken to address these new changes in the
  system. This paper presents an open-source reliability assessment tool
  for smart and active distribution systems named
  <monospace>RELSAD</monospace>.</p>
  <p><monospace>RELSAD</monospace> – RELiability tool for Smart and
  Active Distribution networks is a Python-based reliability assessment
  tool that aims to function as a foundation for reliability calculation
  of modern distribution systems. RELSAD can be used by scientists,
  engineers, and Distribution System Operators (DSO) for the planning
  and operation of modern distribution system where the goal is to
  investigate the reliability of a given system. The tool allows for
  Monte Carlo simulation based reliability analysis of modern
  distribution networks, and sequential simulation of the network
  behavior with user-defined loading and failure evolution to
  investigate the impact of the introduction of for instance ICT
  components. The package supports user-selected time increment steps
  over a user-defined time period. In the tool, active components such
  as microgrids, distributed generation, batteries, and electrical
  vehicles are implemented. To evaluate smart power systems, ICT
  components such as automated switches, sensors, and control system for
  the power grid are also implemented. In addition to component
  implementation, in order to evaluate the reliability of such complex
  systems, the complexity, dependencies within a system, and
  interdependencies between systems and components are accounted
  for.</p>
  <p><monospace>RELSAD</monospace> offers the following features:</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>One of the most important tasks of the DSO is to ensure a safe
  operation of the power system where the needed electrical power
  reaches the end-users. With the increased complexity of the system,
  new situations affecting the distribution system reliability will
  occur. Power system reliability addresses the issues of interruption
  in service and the loss of power supply. The traditional reliability
  analysis methods for distribution systems do not fully comprehend the
  increased complexity in the system and do not account for the
  structural changes and time dependencies brought by, for example, RES
  and ICT. With the increased penetration of RES with power that vary
  over time, analyzing the power system under varying conditions is
  important for the reliability of the system.</p>
  <p>In literature, reliability evaluation of distribution systems is
  conducted either through analytical approaches or by simulation.
  Billinton &amp; Allan

  have been pioneers in power system reliability and describe multiple
  analytical approaches for evaluating the reliability of distribution
  systems. In an analytical approach, a mathematical representation of
  the distribution system is constructed by evaluating the components
  and the relation between them. Markov models can be applied to capture
  the dynamics in the system behavior. An alternative approach, RELRAD –
  an analytical approach for distribution system reliability assessment,
  uses the fault contribution from all the power system components to
  calculate the individual load point reliability in a radially operated
  system
  (<xref alt="Kjølle &amp; Sand, 1992" rid="ref-KjølleU003A1992" ref-type="bibr">Kjølle
  &amp; Sand, 1992</xref>). However, these methods consider passive
  operation of the network and are therefore not optimal when analyzing
  modern distribution systems.</p>
  <p>Simulation gives a more accurate representation of a modern system
  where active networks are to be considered. In
  (<xref alt="Escalera et al., 2018" rid="ref-escaleraU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Escalera
  et al., 2018</xref>), Monte Carlo simulation is highlighted as a good
  approach for evaluating the reliability of modern power systems. In
  addition, the paper points out the need for new reliability assessment
  tools for such systems. In such a tool, the dynamics and the
  interconnection of the system can be studied. There is some literature
  that has used Monte Carlo simulation as a method to evaluate the
  reliability of modern distribution systems
  (<xref alt="Borges, 2012" rid="ref-borgesU003A2012" ref-type="bibr">Borges,
  2012</xref>;
  <xref alt="Celli et al., 2013" rid="ref-celliU003A2013" ref-type="bibr">Celli
  et al., 2013</xref>;
  <xref alt="Quevedo et al., 2017" rid="ref-deU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Quevedo
  et al., 2017</xref>). However, the literature does not bring forward a
  general and open method or tool for the reliability assessment of
  modern distribution systems.</p>
  <p>The reliability of the distribution system is often described
  through customer-oriented indices. The customer-oriented indices aim
  to indicate the reliability of the distribution system based on the
  interruption experienced by the customers in the system. Some of the
  most commonly used indices are the System Average Interruption
  Frequency Index (SAIFI) which gives the average experienced
  interruption for the customers and the System Average Interruption
  Duration Index (SAIDI) which gives the average experienced duration of
  interruption for the customers. Additionally, indices such as Energy
  not Supplied and component-oriented indices which for example give the
  expected availability of the component, are also common to use. In
  RELSAD, multiple indices are implemented in order to give the user a
  great opportunity for reliability analysis.</p>
  <p><monospace>RELSAD</monospace> is a simulation tool that uses Monte
  Carlo simulations for the reliability assessment of distribution
  systems. The tool is based upon some principles from the analytical
  approach RELRAD when calculating the individual load point reliability
  of the system. Compared to the traditional methods,
  <monospace>RELSAD</monospace> comprehends the complexity and time
  dependencies that arise in modern distribution systems.</p>

  <title>Package structure</title>
  <p><monospace>RELSAD</monospace> consists of an electric power system
  model and an ICT system model that constitutes the system network
  model. <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Astructure">Figure 1</xref>
  gives an overview of how the systems and components in
  <monospace>RELSAD</monospace> are structured. In addition, the
  connection between the components and networks is illustrated. The
  user builds up one network or several networks or can use the
  implemented test networks. In the distribution network, components
  such as lines, buses, and switches (discounters and circuit breakers)
  can be added to make the system topology. In addition to the
  distribution network, an ICT network can be constructed and connected
  to the distribution system through ICT components. The implemented ICT
  components are illustrated in
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Astructure">Figure 1</xref>. The
  sensors can be placed on the electrical lines in the distribution
  system, and will then be able to monitor the line. The intelligent
  switch can be placed on disconnectors in the system to allow for
  automated control of the switch. Through an ICT network, the sensor
  and the intelligent switch can communicate with the controller (data
  center) representing the operation center of the DSO.</p>
  <p>The components in the network can be assigned reliability data were
  given specifications of the components can be decided. Additionally,
  the user is free to set the load and generation profiles for the loads
  and generation units in the network. The user can then select the time
  increment and period of the simulation.</p>
