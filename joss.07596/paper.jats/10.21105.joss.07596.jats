  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Stylistic devices are delibarately chosen linguistic expressions
  that are used to convey a certain meaning or effect. They are often
  used in literature to create a certain atmosphere or to convey a
  certain message. Due to this matter, the detection of stylistic
  devices in text is an important task in stylometry, the study of
  linguistic style. Often, finding these stylistic devices is a tedious
  and costly process that involves close reading of the texts, ideally
  by multiple experts. This is extra costly especially if researchers
  aim to statistically analyze the usage of stylistic devices across
  various texts.</p>
  <p>To improve this state, this package provides an easy-to-use
  command-line interface for detecting stylistic devices in text. The
  tool can be configured with a simple configuration file. It is
  designed to be usable by both experts and non-experts in programming.
  For those proficient in Python, this package also provides a library
  with a collection of classes to detect stylistic devices in text,
  together with customizable text preprocessing (tokenizing, POS
  tagging, etc.).</p>
  <p>The command-line tool is to be used on plain text files. It
  preprocesses the text, detects the stylistic devices specified in the
  configuration file, and writes the annotations to a JSON file. The
  classes contained in the library can be used to work with the text in
  a more flexible way, e.g. by using different preprocessing methods or
  already preprocessed text. The resulting annotations can be saved in a
  JSON file or directly used as a data structure in Python. Additionally
  the library is easily extendable with your custom stylistic device
  detectors.</p>

<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Freestylo is a package that provides a collection of approaches to
  detect stylistic devices in text. While there exists a great variety
  of NLP libraries like NLTK
  (<xref alt="Bird &amp; Loper, 2004" rid="ref-nltk" ref-type="bibr">Bird
  &amp; Loper, 2004</xref>), spaCy
  (<xref alt="Honnibal et al., 2020" rid="ref-spacy" ref-type="bibr">Honnibal
  et al., 2020</xref>), or CLTK
  (<xref alt="Johnson et al., 2021" rid="ref-cltk" ref-type="bibr">Johnson
  et al., 2021</xref>), and command-line tools like CWB
  (<xref alt="Evert &amp; Hardie, 2011" rid="ref-cwb" ref-type="bibr">Evert
  &amp; Hardie, 2011</xref>) or UCS
  (<xref alt="Evert, 2005" rid="ref-ucs" ref-type="bibr">Evert,
  2005</xref>), for the processing and low-level analysis of text, there
  is a lack of tools that are specifically designed for the detection of
  stylistic devices. Current options in this space for figurative
  language would be the online tool Figurative Checker
  (<xref alt="Ahmad, 2023" rid="ref-figurativechecker2023" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad,
  2023</xref>) or the MMFLD framework
  (<xref alt="Lai et al., 2023" rid="ref-lai-etal-2023-multi" ref-type="bibr">Lai
  et al., 2023</xref>), which is a Python framework. Other frameworks
  would be Kühn et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-kuhn2024antithesis" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  for the detection of antithesis, Li et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-Li2023MetaphorDV" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
  for the detection of metaphors, Schneider et al.
  (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-schneider2021datadriven" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
  for the detection of chiasmus, or Dubremetz &amp; Nivre
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-dubremetz2017chiasmus" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
  for antimetabole detection. Other tools are available – e.g. Coles
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-coles2019rhyme" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  and Marozick et al.
  (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-marozick2021rap" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
  for the detection of rhymes.</p>
  <p>However, most of those frameworks are not available as a
  ready-to-use tool, but as frameworks or code implementations of
  papers. Also, many are only available for a specific language. A
  commercial tool that was designed as an aid for writers is the
  ProWritingAid
  (<xref alt="ProWritingAid Team, 2025" rid="ref-prowritingaid2025" ref-type="bibr">ProWritingAid
  Team, 2025</xref>), which seems to be able to find various features of
  texts. However, the whole extent of this tool is not visible from its
  informational material. Another commercial tool which is able to find
  stylistic devices such as animalification, similes, imagery,
  onomatopoeia, epizeuxis, and anadiplosis is the Literary Device
  Analyzer
  (<xref alt="Aussie AI Team, 2025" rid="ref-aussieai_literary_device_analyzer" ref-type="bibr">Aussie
  AI Team, 2025</xref>).</p>
  <p>Despite the name similarity, this package is not related to the R
  stylo package
  (<xref alt="Eder et al., 2016" rid="ref-eder2016stylor" ref-type="bibr">Eder
  et al., 2016</xref>). The R stylo package is a package for high-level
  analysis of the writing style in a stylometric context, e.g. for
  authorship attribution. While the results of this package can also be
  used to compare the styles of different authors, the focus of this
  package is on the detection of stylistic devices in text. The
  resulting detections can be used for various purposes, e.g. for the
  comparison of different text genres or time periods, or also for
  direct stylometry tasks like authorship attribution.</p>
  <p>Information about the usage of stylistic devices is important for
  many branches of stylometry, especially for the analysis of literary
  texts. This package aims to fill this gap by providing an easy-to-use
  tool and library for the detection of those stylistic devices. Due to
  its simple and easily configurable command-line interface, the tool
  itself is geared not only to people with programming knowledge, but
  also to literary scholars who use distant reading methods in their
  research. Additionally, it supports multiple languages by design and
  is easy to extend to other languages. The software contained in this
  package is designed to be used either as a library, in other Python
  programs, or as a stand-alone command-line tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="design-and-supported-stylistic-devices">
  <title>Design and supported stylistic devices</title>
  <p>The package contains a collection of approaches to detect stylistic
  devices in text. By default, the preprocessing is done by spaCy
  (<xref alt="Honnibal et al., 2020" rid="ref-spacy" ref-type="bibr">Honnibal
  et al., 2020</xref>) or CLTK
  (<xref alt="Johnson et al., 2021" rid="ref-cltk" ref-type="bibr">Johnson
  et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, the supported devices all work on a
  word level. They rely either on supporting words, a word pair, or
  multiple consecutive related words. It would be possible to extend the
  package with other stylistic devices that follow similar principles.
  Additionally, the structure of the underlying framework is not
  restricted to these kinds of devices. The same annotation method could
  be used to – for example – mark scene boundaries and topic boundaries
  or changes in the tense of the text. The following stylistic devices
  are currently supported:</p>
  <sec id="chiasmus">
    <title>Chiasmus</title>
    <p>This package includes the current state-of-the-art approach by
    Schneider et al.
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-schneider2021datadriven" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    to detect chiasmi in text. A chiasmus is a rhetorical device that
    consists of two parallel phrases, where the second phrase is a
    semantically related inversion of the first phrase. For example, the
    phrase “Hard is the task, the samples are few” is a phrase that
    emphasizes the problem of missing examples with the oppositional
    posing of the words “hard” and “few”.</p>
    <p>The chiasmus detector contained in this package has been trained
    using the dataset published by Schneider et al.
    (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-schneider2023hard" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).
    It works for English, German, and Middle High German. It has been
    trained with word vectors provided by the German
    <monospace>de_core_news_lg</monospace> model by spaCy
    (<xref alt="Honnibal et al., 2020" rid="ref-spacy" ref-type="bibr">Honnibal
    et al., 2020</xref>) However, since the model does not use the word
    vectors directly, but only their cosine similarity, it can be used
    with any word vectors, as long as they provide a vector for each
    token in the text.</p>
    <p>The chiasmus detector needs some special lists to function
    properly:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p>denylist: a list of part-of-speech (POS) tags that are not
        allowed to be part of a chiasmus.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>allowlist: a list of POS tags that are allowed to be part of
        a chiasmus. Be careful: if such a list is given, no other POS
        tags are allowed to be part of a chiasmus.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>neglist: a list of negations in the target language.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>conjlist: a list of conjunctions in the target language.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>For English, German, and Middle High German, defaults for the
    lists are provided in the package. However, you can provide your own
    lists if you want to use the chiasmus detector for a different
    language or if you want to use a different set of POS tags, for
    example.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="metaphor">
    <title>Metaphor</title>
    <p>The metaphor detection approach in this package has specifically
    been developed for the low-resource language Middle High German, but
    can also be applied to more common high-resource languages.
    Specifically, adjective–noun metaphors like “thirsty car” are
    detected using a machine learning–based rating model. The detector
    is based on the publication by Schneider et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-schneider2022metaphor" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p>
    <p>Currently, the metaphor detector is available for English and
    Middle High German. The word vectors are expected to be generated by
    the spaCy model <monospace>en_core_web_lg</monospace> for English
    and by the provided word vector FastText model for Middle High
    German.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="alliteration-and-alliterative-verse">
    <title>Alliteration and alliterative verse</title>
    <p>The package further contains a detector for both alliteration and
    alliterative verse. Alliteration comprise phrases where the initial
    letters of words are the same. Since alliteration is a simple
    stylistic device, the detector is based on a simple rule-based
    approach that orders all alliterations in the given text by the
    number of words that are alliterated in the phrase. Additionally,
    the detector can also find alliterative verses, which can contain
    some additional words in between the words with the same initial
    letter. An example for alliterative verse would be “Pondering on the
    pending paper, I programmed the Python package.” The user can
    specify the maximum number of words that are allowed to be in
    between the alliterated words, as well as words and POS tags that do
    not count towards the non-alliterated words. For example, spaCy also
    tags punctuation and newlines, so the user can specify those to be
    excluded from the alliteration.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="epiphora">
    <title>Epiphora</title>
    <p>An epiphora is a rhetorical device that consists of multiple
    parallel phrases, where the last word of each phrase is the same.
    For example, “I thought of the paper, I wrote the paper, I published
    the paper” is an epiphora that emphasizes the importance of the
    paper. The way this detector works is by splitting the text into
    sentences, and then those sentences into phrases. The detector
    searches for adjacent phrases that end with the same word. Those
    phrase collections are then sorted by the number of phrases in the
    collection.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="polysyndeton">
    <title>Polysyndeton</title>
    <p>A polysyndeton is a rhetorical device that consists of multiple
    parallel phrases, where each phrase is connected by a conjunction.
    For example, “I thought of the paper, and then I started writing it,
    and then I published it, and then I received a lot of citations” is
    a polysyndeton that, in a broader context with a slower feel to it,
    emphasizes the the process of writing and publishing a paper. The
    detector works by getting a list of all conjunctions, or by getting
    the POS tag of conjunctions, or by getting both, and then splitting
    the text into sentences, and then counting the conjunctions in each
    sentence, and then sorting the sentences by number of
    conjunctions.</p>
  </sec>
</sec>
<sec id="usage">
  <title>Usage</title>
  <p>The package can be used both as a library and as a stand-alone
  command-line tool. Both from the library and from the command-line
  tool, the results can be saved in a JSON file. This JSON file will
  contain the complete tokenized text. When using the functions from the
  library, the result will be a Python container with a similar
  structure to the JSON file.</p>
  <p>The stand-alone version can be configured using a simple JSON
  configuration file. The file should specify the language of the text
  and the stylistic devices to detect. The following is an example
  configuration file:</p>
  <code language="json">{
    &quot;language&quot;: &quot;de&quot;,
    &quot;annotations&quot;: {
        &quot;chiasmus&quot;: {
            &quot;window_size&quot;: 30,
            &quot;allowlist&quot;: [&quot;NOUN&quot;, &quot;VERB&quot;, &quot;ADJ&quot;, &quot;ADV&quot;],
            &quot;denylist&quot;: [],
            &quot;model&quot;: &quot;/chiasmus_de.pkl&quot;
        }
    }
}</code>
  <p>You can then run the tool using the following command:</p>
  <code language="bash">freestylo --config config.json --input input.txt --output output.json</code>
  <p>This will read the text from the file
  <monospace>input.txt</monospace>, preprocess (tokenize, POS-tag, etc.)
  the text, detect the stylistic devices specified in the configuration
  file, and write the results to the file
  <monospace>output.json</monospace>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="creating-your-own-detectors">
  <title>Creating your own detectors</title>
  <p>The package is designed to be easily extendable with your own
  stylistic device detectors. The <monospace>src</monospace> folder
  contains example scripts that show how you can retrain the models for
  the existing chiasmus and metaphor detectors. You can also create your
  own stylistic device detectors by referring to the existing ones. The
  Alliteration Detector in particular provides a very simple example
  that can be used as a template for your own detectors. Please refer to
  the

  detectors and contribute to the project. If you create and want to
  contribute your own detecors, pull requests are very welcome!</p>
