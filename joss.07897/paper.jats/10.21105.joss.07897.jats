  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a scientific method used in fields
  such as social science, biology, and ecology to simulate interactions
  of autonomous agents and study the resulting emergent phenomena. The
  relationships between agents, which structure the simulated
  interactions, are often represented by network graphs. Since empirical
  data on networks is rare, many agent-based models rely on artificially
  generated networks
  (<xref alt="Amblard et al., 2015" rid="ref-amblard_which_2015" ref-type="bibr">Amblard
  et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, generating a valid network
  structure at the beginning of a simulation is critical. Additionally,
  accessing and modifying the network during the simulation are steps
  that must be managed in almost any agent-based model.</p>
  <p>Pop2net is a Python package that combines many steps related to
  network generation and management for ABM using a bipartite approach.
  Bipartite networks consist of two distinct types of entities where
  edges are only formed between entities of different types. In Pop2net,
  relationships are represented as bipartite networks connecting
  <italic>actors</italic> and <italic>locations</italic>. When two
  actors are linked to the same location, they are considered connected
  through that shared location. In this way, locations serve as a
  contact layer between actors, representing places where interactions
  occur or contexts that facilitate actor connections. The aim of
  Pop2net’s bipartite approach to relations is to simplify the
  generation and management of realistic network structures in ABM.</p>

  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>In Python, NetworkX
  (<xref alt="Hagberg et al., 2008" rid="ref-hagberg_exploring_2008" ref-type="bibr">Hagberg
  et al., 2008</xref>) provides extensive control over network
  structures and a wide range of ready-to-use network models. However,
  NetworkX was not originally designed with ABM in mind, which can make
  managing networks or creating custom network structures within ABM
  frameworks cumbersome and inflexible. While the built-in network
  models are powerful, they are often too abstract to directly support
  the specific needs of ABM applications.</p>
  <p>ABM frameworks in Python—such as Mesa
  (<xref alt="Hoeven et al., 2025" rid="ref-hoeven_mesa_2025" ref-type="bibr">Hoeven
  et al., 2025</xref>;
  <xref alt="Kazil et al., 2020" rid="ref-kazil_utilizing_2020" ref-type="bibr">Kazil
  et al., 2020</xref>), AgentPy
  (<xref alt="Foramitti, 2021" rid="ref-foramitti_agentpy_2021" ref-type="bibr">Foramitti,
  2021</xref>), and Melodie
  (<xref alt="Yu &amp; Hou, 2023" rid="ref-yu_melodie_2023" ref-type="bibr">Yu
  &amp; Hou, 2023</xref>)—offer improved data structures for
  representing and manipulating networks. However, they still lack
  advanced tools for generating custom network topologies and provide
  only limited out-of-the-box support for bipartite graphs.</p>
  <p>Pop2net aims to address this gap in the toolkit of agent-based
  modelers. Building upon NetworkX, we provide an extensive tool
  designed to simplify and streamline the generation of (empirically
  calibrated) bipartite networks for further use with common ABM
  frameworks. While Pop2net is implemented in Python, to our knowledge,
  no comparable software exists in other programming environments that
  offers the following features:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Bringing bipartite networks to agent-based
      modeling.</bold> Pop2net implements a bipartite approach to
      networks in ABM, which can simplify their creation and management
      by organizing relations through locations. Especially in models
      that simulate humans interacting in specific places or connected
      through shared contexts, organizing relationships through
      locations can be far more intuitive and easier to manage. While
      this approach is already common in epidemiological ABM (e.g., Kerr
      et al.
      (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-kerr_covasim_2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>),
      Vermeulen et al.
      (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-vermeulen_social_2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>),
      Kaffai &amp; Heiberger
      (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-kaffai_modeling_2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)),
      Pop2net is the first software package to generalize the bipartite
      approach for ABM. Pop2net can serve as the foundation for custom
      simulation frameworks or be seamlessly integrated into the widely
      used ABM frameworks Mesa and AgentPy.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Generating scalable and modular networks.</bold> Based on
      the bipartite approach, Pop2net offers an innovative way of
      creating networks programmatically and modularly. Users can
      quickly create complex networks based on different location
      definitions that are translated into network structures. Each
      location definition contains a set of rules for how agents
      connect, and can integrate empirical data as well as classic
      network models.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Integrating micro-level data.</bold> Pop2net is designed
      to integrate empirical micro-level data, e.g., from surveys, into
      the population and network generation processes. The empirical
      micro-level data can be used to generate a population of actors
      and then refer to the empirical attributes when determining the
      rules of how actors connect via location definitions. This enables
      users, especially those from the social sciences, to ground
      network generation in empirical data, even in the absence of
      detailed network data.</p>

  <title>Software structure</title>
  <p>Pop2net’s components can be categorized into three sectors.</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Basic elements for bipartite networks in ABM.</bold> The
      first sector contains the three object classes—Environment, Actor,
      and Location—that must always be used to facilitate the bipartite
      network structure of Pop2net.</p>
      <p>The Environment class is Pop2net’s main object that holds all
      entities and manages their relations. It is designed for use
      within simulation models. Central attributes of the Environment
      class are:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>A NetworkX graph object that stores all actors, locations,
          and their relationships.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>An actor list and a location list that provide convenient
          access to actor and location objects.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Various methods for managing tasks such as connecting
          actors and locations or exporting the network.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Actors are the (inter)acting entities in the simulation—what is
      typically referred to as <italic>agents</italic> in ABM. However,
      since Pop2net also treats locations as <italic>agents</italic>,
      especially when integrated with frameworks like Mesa or AgentPy,
      we found it clearer to refer to the primary acting entities as
      <italic>actors</italic>. Locations represent the places or
      contexts in which actors interact. In Pop2net, every connection
      between actors must be mediated by a location. Both actors and
      locations provide several methods which help to manage relations
      during simulations—for example, to retrieve all associated
      locations or actors, find neighboring actors within specific
      location types, or connect actors to one another through certain
      locations. Using multiple inheritance, actors and locations can
      also be integrated as agent objects into Mesa and AgentPy.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Network generators.</bold> The classes Creator and
      LocationDesigner are the tools in Pop2net that enable the user to
      generate custom (bipartite) networks in a modular and scalable
      way. By defining location types using the LocationDesigner, users
      can, for instance, quickly specify which agent should be connected
      to a certain location type, how many location instances should be
      created, whether locations are nested within other locations, or
      how strongly the connection between an actor and a location is
      weighted. Based on these definitions, the Creator class generates
      a bipartite network of actors and locations. The generated
      networks and their components can serve as the basis for
      simulation models or be exported to NetworkX in both bipartite and
      unipartite formats.</p>
      <p>The Creator also provides convenient methods to generate actors
      and their attributes directly from empirical micro-level data,
      e.g., survey data. Those empirically created attributes support
      the creation of realistic network structures by including them in
      the location definitions, for instance, the age or the household
      of the actors. Location types can also incorporate network graphs
      based on empirical data or generated by NetworkX.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Inspection tools.</bold> The NetworkInspector class
      provides methods for quick network analysis, such as visualization
      and the calculation of network measures.</p>

  <title>Example of network generation</title>
  <p>The following example demonstrates how to generate a network with
  different location types and assign actors to these locations based on
  their attributes using Pop2net. It involves loading micro-level data,
  defining rules for location creation and actor assignment, and finally
  sampling and connecting actors to locations accordingly.</p>

    def weight(self, actor):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Set the weight between the actor and the location.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def filter(self, actor):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Only assign actors with more than 0 work hours to this location type.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return actor.work_hours &gt; 0
