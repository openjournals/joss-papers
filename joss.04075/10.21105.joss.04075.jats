  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>SenAOReFoc is a closed-loop sensorbased adaptive optics (AO) and
  remote focusing control software that works with a deformable mirror
  (DM) and a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS). It provides a
  user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) with modular widget
  arrangements and clear labelling to help the user navigate through
  different software functionalities. Interactive messages are also
  displayed from the GUI for user guidance.</p>
  <p>SenAOReFoc consists of 5 main units, the SHWS initialisation and DM
  calibration unit, the Zernike aberration input unit, the AO control
  and data collection unit, the miscellaneous control unit, and the
  remote focusing unit, as shown in
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Agui">Figure 1</xref>. The software
  can be ran in either ‘debug mode’ to perform functionality tests
  without connected hardware (DM and SHWS), or ‘standard mode’ on a
  well-aligned optical sectioning microscope (confocal, multiphoton,
  etc.). User controllable system parameters can be freely accessed and
  modified in a separate configuration file that is loaded upon software
  initialisation, and parameters that require continuous user input can
  be modified from the GUI. Parameters calculated when running the
  software, as well as important result data, are grouped and saved in a
  separate HDF5 file that can be read with HDFView software. Automated
  AO performance characterisations can be performed in ‘standard mode’
  to assess the correction ability of the optical system. If the adopted
  DM is designed with a large stroke, i.e., is capable of large
  deformations, both the closed-loop AO correction and remote focusing
  functionalities can be exploited. On the other hand, if the DM
  exhibits insufficient stroke for remote focusing, by ignoring the
  remote focusing unit, closed-loop AO correction functionalities will
  still be fully functional without additional modifications to the
  software.</p>
  <p>Closed-loop AO correction can be performed using both the zonal
  method, which updates DM control voltages in terms of the raw slope
  values; and the modal method, which updates DM control voltages in
  terms of orthogonal Zernike polynomials. There are four sub-modes
  tagged to each of the two methods: 1) standard closed-loop AO
  correction; 2) closed-loop AO correction with consideration of
  obscured search blocks; 3) closed-loop AO correction with partial
  correction excluding defocus; and 4) closed-loop AO correction with
  both consideration of obscured search blocks and partial correction
  excluding defocus.</p>
  <p>Remote focusing can be performed by scanning the focus axially with
  a pre-determined axial range, step increment and step number, or by
  manually adjusting a toggle bar on the GUI for random access remote
  focusing. The former also incorporates options of whether or not to
  perform closed-loop AO correction at each remote focusing depth.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The performance of optical microscopes degrades significantly in
  the presence of optical aberrations that develop due to misalignments
  in the optical system and inhomogeneities in refractive index of the
  imaging sample. This results in compromised image resolution and
  contrast. Adaptive optics (AO) is a powerful technique that corrects
  for optical aberrations using reconfigurable adaptive devices, such as
  a deformable mirror (DM) or spatial light modulator (SLM), to restore
  the image quality
  (<xref alt="Booth, 2014" rid="ref-Booth2014LightScienceU0026Applications" ref-type="bibr">Booth,
  2014</xref>). This is most crucial for high-quality imaging, such as
  super-resolution or deep imaging.</p>
  <p>Remote focusing is an axial scanning technique recently introduced
  to avoid slow movements of the sample stage and objective lens during
  real-time applications
  (<xref alt="Ji et al., 2016" rid="ref-Ji2016NatureNeuroscience" ref-type="bibr">Ji
  et al., 2016</xref>). By using a DM for remote focusing, calibration
  can be performed through closed-loop AO correction to simultaneously
  correct for system aberrations introduced by beam divergence at
  different focusing depths
  (<xref alt="Žurauskas et al., 2017" rid="ref-Zurauskas2017BiomedicalOpticsExpress" ref-type="bibr">Žurauskas
  et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
  <p>Sensorbased AO, which uses a dedicated sensor to measure the
  wavefront
  (<xref alt="Platt &amp; Shack, 2001" rid="ref-Platt2001JournalofRefractiveSurgery" ref-type="bibr">Platt

  astronomy
  (<xref alt="Beckers, 1993" rid="ref-Beckers1993" ref-type="bibr">Beckers,
  1993</xref>). Since then, it has also been widely adopted in vision
  science

  <xref alt="Ji, 2017" rid="ref-Ji2017NatureMethods" ref-type="bibr">Ji,

  purposes have been introduced over time, including those for
  simulation of AO systems

  et al., 2005</xref>;

  &amp; Correia, 2014</xref>), control with atmospheric tomography
  (<xref alt="Ahmadia &amp; Ellerbroek, 2005" rid="ref-Ahmadia2005" ref-type="bibr">Ahmadia
  &amp; Ellerbroek, 2005</xref>), and fast control using GPU hardware
  (<xref alt="Guyon et al., 2018" rid="ref-Guyon2018" ref-type="bibr">Guyon
  et al., 2018</xref>). In the microscopy community, software is also
  openly available for AO modelling and analysis
  (<xref alt="Townson et al., 2019" rid="ref-Townson2019OpticsExpress" ref-type="bibr">Townson
  et al., 2019</xref>), as well as general AO control
  (<xref alt="Hall et al., 2020" rid="ref-Hall2020OpticsExpress" ref-type="bibr">Hall
  et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is not yet an existing
  open-source software that serves the purpose of performing both AO and
  remote focusing within the single package, despite that the techniques
  have been widely adopted. As a result, time and effort has to be spent
  reimplementing existing techniques for different hardware systems.</p>
  <p>SenAOReFoc aims to fill this gap and to make closed-loop
  sensorbased AO
  (<xref alt="Fernández et al., 2001" rid="ref-Fernandez2001OpticsLetters" ref-type="bibr">Fernández
  et al., 2001</xref>) and remote focusing more easily accessible to the
  microscopy community. It has been designed for open development and
  easy integration into existing adaptive optical microscopes with a
  simple and user-friendly architecture. The functionality of the
  software has also been tested on different operating systems
  (Windows/Linux/macOS) for sake of generality. The software fully
  operates in Windows under both ‘debug mode’ and ‘standard mode’ for
  hardware control. For Linux and macOS, functionality tests in ‘debug
  mode’ passes for both systems when hardware packages are not imported.
  Python-bindings for Ximea cameras and Python 3.8-binding for Alpao DMs
  are compatible with Linux systems, and other Python-bindings for Alpao
  DMs in Linux should also be compatible following their release.
  However, we note that SenAOReFoc is a control software, and the
  performance of the closed-loop AO correction in practice is inevitably
  dependent on the state of the optical system. Finally, SenAOReFoc
  takes care of some reported issues in the field, such as the thermal
  effects of electromagnetic DMs
  (<xref alt="Bitenc, 2017" rid="ref-Bitenc2017OpticsExpress" ref-type="bibr">Bitenc,
  2017</xref>), and obscured search blocks in the case of severely
  distorted pupils

  <xref alt="Ye et al., 2015" rid="ref-Ye2015OpticsExpress" ref-type="bibr">Ye
  et al., 2015</xref>). In the former case, an option is provided to
  exercise the DM membrane by sending routine sets of random control
  voltages to the actuators upon software initialisation. In the latter
  case, control algorithms for both the zonal and modal methods are
  modified as compared to the standard case to ensure the orthogonality
  of control.</p>
