  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionised transcriptomics
  analysis by preserving tissue architecture, allowing researchers to
  study gene expression in its native spatial context. However, despite
  its potential, ST still faces significant technical challenges. Two
  major issues include: (1) the integration of raw data into coherent
  and reproducible analysis workflows, and (2) the accurate assignment
  of transcripts to individual cells. To address these challenges, we
  present MOSAIK, the first fully integrated, end-to-end workflow that
  supports raw data from both NanoString CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager
  (CosMx) and 10x Genomics Xenium In Situ (Xenium). MOSAIK (Multi-Origin
  Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis and Integration Kit) unifies
  transcriptomics and imaging data into a single Python object based on
  the spatialdata format. This unified structure ensures compatibility
  with a broad range of Python tools, enabling robust quality control
  and downstream analyses. With MOSAIK, users can perform advanced
  analyses such as re-segmentation (to more accurately assign
  transcripts to individual cells), cell typing, tissue domain
  identification, and cell-cell communication within a seamless and
  reproducible Python environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of transcriptomes
  within intact tissues, which is essential for understanding a cell’s
  position relative to its neighbours and the surrounding extracellular
  structures. This spatial context provides crucial insights into
  cellular phenotype, function, and disease progression, particularly in
  cancer, where the tumour micro-environment (TME) influences processes
  such as chemo-resistance
  (<xref alt="Mehraj et al., 2021" rid="ref-mehraj_tumor_2021" ref-type="bibr">Mehraj
  et al., 2021</xref>). The commercialisation of ST platforms has
  expanded access to these technologies, earning ST the title of “Method
  of the Year 2020” by Nature Methods
  (<xref alt="Marx, 2021" rid="ref-marx_method_2021" ref-type="bibr">Marx,
  2021</xref>).</p>
  <p>Imaging-based fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
  technologies provide high-multiplex, subcellular-resolution
  transcriptomics data across over one million cells. These platforms,
  such as CosMx by NanoString and Xenium by 10x Genomics, offer high
  sensitivity and specificity, facilitating the exploration of cell
  atlases, cell–cell interactions, and the phenotypic architecture of
  the TME
  (<xref alt="Chen et al., 2015" rid="ref-chen_spatially_2015" ref-type="bibr">Chen
  et al., 2015</xref>;
  <xref alt="Vandereyken et al., 2023" rid="ref-vandereyken_methods_2023" ref-type="bibr">Vandereyken
  et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
  <p>Despite the promise of ST, significant technical challenges remain.
  Two primary challenges include: (1) the integration of raw ST data
  into standardised and reproducible analysis workflows, which is
  complicated by variability in platforms and data formats; and (2) the
  accurate assignment of transcripts to individual cells, a task
  complicated by the heterogeneity and complex architecture of tissues.
  These challenges hinder downstream analyses such as cell type
  identification, spatial gene expression mapping, and inference of
  cell-cell interactions. Addressing these challenges is critical for
  fully harnessing the potential of ST. The diversity of technologies
  provides multiple possibilities, each with its own strengths and
  weaknesses, with some offering higher spatial resolution, others
  greater transcriptomics depth, or better compatibility with specific
  tissue types, features that make individual technologies better suited
  to answering distinct biological questions. However, a unified
  workflow that accommodates both platforms, from raw data processing to
  downstream analysis, is still needed. Establishing such a framework
  will streamline cross-platform data integration, unlock the full
  potential of spatial biology, and enable more effective multimodal
  analyses.</p>
  <p>To address the first challenge, we developed a unified workflow
  that supports raw data from both CosMx and Xenium. While a Xenium
  reader already exists and handles multiple modalities effectively,
  CosMx readers lacked robustness in several areas: handling of
  coordinate systems, creation of segmentation polygons, and
  reintegration of multi-channel images. We addressed these limitations
  to ensure the resulting Python object matches the Xenium output
  format. We also aligned the workflow with the most suitable Python
  library, <italic>SpatialData</italic>
  (<xref alt="Marconato et al., 2025" rid="ref-Marconato2025" ref-type="bibr">Marconato
  et al., 2025</xref>), which integrates spatial elements (images,
  transcript locations, cell segmentation labels and shapes (polygons))
  with transcriptomics data into an annotated dataframe suitable for
  single-cell analysis.</p>
  <p>Addressing the second challenge requires precise spatial
  delineation of cells, making cell segmentation a critical step. The
  quality of segmentation directly affects the accuracy of all
  downstream analyses. Our workflow integrates native segmentation
  approaches: CosMx uses a Cellpose-based method
  (<xref alt="Stringer et al., 2021" rid="ref-Stringer2021" ref-type="bibr">Stringer
  et al., 2021</xref>), while Xenium employs a Voronoi expansion
  strategy
  (<xref alt="Janesick et al., 2023" rid="ref-Janesick2023" ref-type="bibr">Janesick
  et al., 2023</xref>). Users may also choose alternative or custom
  segmentation tools, which can offer improved performance but typically
  require careful parameter tuning. Such tuning is difficult to
  implement in tools like Xenium Ranger (10x Genomics) or AtoMx
  (NanoString).</p>
  <p>This integrated pipeline provides a foundation for downstream
  modelling and analysis, offering a scalable solution for tackling key
  challenges in ST, especially in multimodal data integration.</p>

  <title>Overview of the workflow</title>
  <p>The MOSAIK workflow
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/anthbapt/MOSAIK">https://github.com/anthbapt/MOSAIK</ext-link>)
  supports both CosMx and Xenium ST platforms through modular pipelines
  designed for data integration, visualisation, and analysis (Fig. 1).
  For CosMx, data are first exported from the AtoMx platform, including
  all Flat Files and relevant raw files such as Morphology2D. As a first
  step, the data may be visualised in
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://napari.org/stable/">Napari</ext-link>
  according to the guidelines outlined in the documentation. As a second
  step, the data exported from AtoMx are uncompressed and organised
  using helper scripts to generate structured directories (e.g.,
  CellComposite, CellLabels) essential for downstream processing.</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>Figure 1: The MOSAIK workflow is divided into two parts:
    the visualisation component, which enables quality assessment of the
    immunofluorescence staining and verification of cell segmentation;
    and the data integration component, which leads to downstream
    analysis. 1: The MOSAIK visualisation is based on two visualisation
    strategies: On one hand, Napari with the CosMx plugin to visualise
    CosMx data; on the other hand, Xenium Explorer for Xenium data. 2:
    MOSAIK analysis takes the raw data and converts it into a Python
    object, making it easy to perform quality control and facilitate
    downstream analysis.</p></caption>
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="Figure1.png" />
  </fig>
  <p>Structured inputs are then read into the analysis pipeline using a
  custom reader, which extends the spatialdata_io framework to
  incorporate various image types along with cell shape annotations
  (polygons). These information are stored into a Zarr file, which is
  open standard for storing large multidimensional array data. Then,
  resulting Zarr object is processed using Python-based tools such as
  squidpy and spatialdata for quality control and downstream analyses,
  including re-segmentation, cell typing, niche identification, or
  cell-cell communication.</p>
  <p>Xenium data follow a similar pipeline. The data can be visualised
  using the software provided by 10x Genomics,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/xenium-explorer/latest">Xenium
  Explorer</ext-link>. The data exported directly from the instrument
  can then be processed through the reader embedded in MOSAIK and
  converted into a Zarr file. This unified format is subsequently
  analysed using the same set of Python tools, ensuring consistency
  across platforms.</p>
  <p>MOSAIK is the first fully integrated end-to-end workflow that
  supports both CosMx and Xenium raw data, standardising their output
  into a unified spatial data format (Fig. 2). The entire process is
  thoroughly documented in the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/anthbapt/MOSAIK/tree/main">MOSAIK
  GitHub repository</ext-link>, which includes two example workflows:
  one using a publicly available CosMx dataset from the NanoString
  website, and another using a Xenium dataset from the 10x Genomics
  platform.</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>Figure 2:The Python SpatialData object obtained after
    using the MOSAIK workflow embeds both CosMx and Xenium data into
    similar objects, which can be combined or compared. MOSAIK, along
    with the Python library <italic>SpatialData</italic>, allows for the
    visualisation and connection of SpatialElements: Images (e.g.,
    H&amp;E or immunofluorescence stains), Labels (segmentation maps),
    Points (i.e., transcripts), and Shapes (e.g., cell/nucleus
    boundaries or ROIs). The first two objects are raster objects
    (images), and the last two are vector objects (points and polygons).

  <p>Finally, we have created a GitHub repository

  that compiles a collection of Python tools designed to be used
  alongside or after integration with our workflow. These tools support
  a wide range of applications, including segmentation, cell typing,
  domain identification, gene imputation, detection of spatially
  variable genes, cell–cell communication analysis, dimensionality
  reduction, multimodal integration, and the use of foundation models,
  among others. By providing this curated collection, our goal is to
  guide users seamlessly from raw data to advanced analytical
  applications, all within a unified and community-supported
  framework.</p>

  <title>Planned Enhancements</title>
  <p>Recognising that ST is a rapidly evolving field, MOSAIK is designed
  to remain aligned with the latest standards, both in terms of
  experimental setup and raw data processing, as well as on the
  computational side by integrating emerging methods and developmental
  tools. As part of the King’s College London Spatial Biology Facility
  (SBF), MOSAIK must stay up to date to help the SBF fulfil its
  mission.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, newly developed tools within the group will be
  directly integrated into MOSAIK. This will provide the broader
  community with the ability to use both their own methods and those
  developed by our team, methods that have been tested across a wide
  range of tissue types and technologies, thanks to the strong network
  surrounding the facility.</p>
  <p>The tools that will be natively integrated into MOSAIK include
  segmentation methods based on SAM, as well as a multimodal integration
  approach that combines transcriptomics and spatial information to
  generate a more robust latent representation. The current modalities
  under consideration include H&amp;E, Akoya PhenoCycler, IMC, and
  metallomics data.</p>
