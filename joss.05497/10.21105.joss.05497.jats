  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>OpenTera is a microservice-based framework primarily developed to
  support telehealth research projects and real-world deployment. This
  project has 20 years of experience linking at-home participants to
  remote users (such as clinicians, researchers, healthcare, and
  professionals) with audio-video-data connections and in-the-field
  sensors, such as biometrics, wearable, and robotics devices.
  Applications of the OpenTera framework are not limited to research
  projects and could exist in clinical environments.</p>
  <p>Most telehealth-based research projects require a common data
  structure: data collection sites, projects, participants, and
  sessions, including various recorded data types from sensors or other
  sources. They also require standard features: user authentication
  based on various access roles, the ability to add new features based
  on specific project needs, ease of use for the participant, and secure
  data hosting. These features are also shared between research
  projects: videoconferencing with specific health-related features
  (e.g., angles measurement, timers), surveys data collection, data
  analysis, and exportation.</p>
  <p>Many available solutions are costly, feature-limited, proprietary
  (e.g., can hardly be adapted for research purposes, and raw data is
  more complex to access), or hard to deploy in telehealth. OpenTera was
  built for extensibility to provide research projects complete control
  over their data and hosting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>From our research experience, standard features between the
  different telehealth projects emerged:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Data structure.</bold> Store data in a structured way to
      ease data extraction and analysis.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Ecological data capture.</bold> Collect data not only in
      laboratories or controlled environments but also in homes or
      institutions.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Project adaptability.</bold> Develop project-specific
      dashboards and user interfaces while reusing previous
      implementations as much as possible to reduce development time.
      Rehabilitation projects may require implementing serious games or
      exergames, while teleoperation projects may require real-time
      navigation tools. Adapting already existing open-source software
      when possible is often the key.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Cost-effectiveness.</bold> Most commercial cloud
      telehealth applications are subscription-based and do not offer
      the flexibility needed. Each vendor provides its approach tailored
      to its products and services. We often have data collection from
      dozens of participants and users, and paying subscription fees
      would be prohibitive.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Security.</bold> Store and transfer data in a secure and
      controlled way. Access control to information depends on specific
      project requirements. The ethics committee must approve research
      projects involving participants, and they often require servers
      hosted locally or within a particular region.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Uniformity.</bold> Avoid using multiple applications and
      tools requiring the user to navigate between them (minimizing and
      restoring them as needed) and focus on the current task.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Ease of use.</bold> Implement an easy-to-use solution for
      users and participants at all process steps, I.e., authentication,
      data collection, and data management.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Synchronous and asynchronous sessions.</bold> Support
      real-time sessions (synchronous) or on-demand pre-recorded or
      application-based sessions (asynchronous) with multiple users,
      devices, and participants.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>No installation.</bold> Connecting through a web browser
      with a personalized link is favored, avoiding complicated
      installation of apps and login/password/registration steps, which
      are not accessible for everyone, depending on their technological
      literacy. In healthcare establishments, support of deployed apps
      often requires long-term planning and discussions with the
      Information Technology team, as opposed to web-based
      applications.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Long term availability.</bold> Research projects can be
      conducted over a long period, and software versions, data
      structures, APIs, and used features must be stable. There is no
      guarantee that a commercial system with features will be supported
      for the required duration.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Server deployment and management.</bold> Installation on
      low-cost hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pis), local servers, and cloud
      infrastructure can be required, depending on the scale of the
      projects and their location. Deployments should be manageable by a
      small team.</p>

  <title>Existing Open-Source Solutions</title>
  <p>Open-source projects like Big Blue Button, NextCloud Talk, Jami,
  OpenVidu, Jitsi Meet, and Kurento offer excellent videoconferencing
  solutions; however, they still need to meet telehealth requirements
  fully. While there are open-source rehabilitation-oriented
  applications available, such as the OpenRehab
  (<xref alt="Freitas et al., 2017" rid="ref-freitas_openrehab_2017" ref-type="bibr">Freitas
  et al., 2017</xref>) project, which offers multiple rehabilitation
  tools for upper limbs, mobility, fitness, cognition, and balance, they
  often focus on specific domains and primarily contain pre-recorded
  videos or games prescribed by physiotherapists. Most of these
  applications lack teleconsultation features and remote access to
  research data. Open-source Electronic Health/Medical Records (EHR,
  EMR)
  (<xref alt="Goel et al., 2017" rid="ref-neha_intelehealth_2017" ref-type="bibr">Goel
  et al., 2017</xref>) can meet some research requirements, but storing
  personal and sensitive information on participants could be better. We
  prefer to use or connect to existing systems that comply with local
  regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
  Act (HIPAA).</p>

  <title>OpenTera Features</title>
  <p>OpenTera is specifically designed to address the previously
  mentioned and required features for research. It leverages a
  microservice architecture based on recognized standards and best
  practices. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility,
  resilience, maintainability, and technology diversity, all needed in
  research.</p>
  <p>OpenTera contains the base server (TeraServer) offering a REST API
  (<xref alt="Fielding &amp; Taylor, 2002" rid="ref-fielding_rest_2002" ref-type="bibr">Fielding
  &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>), which helps manage users, participants,
  devices, sites, projects, sessions, and supports multiple
  authentication methods via user/password, certificates, or tokens.
  TeraServer also manages authorizations for users, participants, and
  devices, providing fine-grained access control on resources and
  assets.</p>
  <p>OpenTera also includes base services: Video Rehabilitation,
  Logging, and File Transfer. They are used to conduct audio/video
  WebRTC sessions from the web along with appropriate logging and file
  transfer capabilities. Structured sessions enable organized
  information such as survey data, sensor data, metadata, analytics, and
  facilitate the retrieval of information and key statistics. Developing
  new microservices allows developers to add new features to the system,
  such as serious or exergames, exercise coaches/videos, and participant
  calendar/portal.</p>

  teleoperation during
  COVID(<xref alt="Panchea, 2022" rid="ref-panchea_opentera_2022" ref-type="bibr">Panchea,

  choices for a more generic OpenTera framework focusing on open-source
  implementation. Code quality, documentation, examples, and usability
  have been greatly improved between these versions.</p>
