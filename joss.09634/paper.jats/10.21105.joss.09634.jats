  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>ThRasE is an open-source QGIS plugin designed for systematic
  review, manual correction, and quality assurance of thematic rasters.
  It offers synchronized multi-panel views for side-by-side and overlap
  comparisons with reference data. It utilizes a recode pixel table to
  modify multiple classes simultaneously in one operation with various
  editing tool options. An integrated modification tracking system
  automatically records all changes, providing spatial feedback,
  transparency, and reproducibility. Systematic tile-based navigation
  ensures complete spatial coverage during inspection, while session
  persistence enables seamless multi-day workflows.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Thematic maps serve as indispensable analytical tools that simplify
  complex, continuous spatial data into visually accessible
  representations for a wide range of disciplines and applications.
  However, mapping workflows inevitably introduce errors, making quality
  assurance essential for reliable spatial data and informed
  decision-making
  (<xref alt="Foody, 2001" rid="ref-foodyU003A2001" ref-type="bibr">Foody,
  2001</xref>). Because maps are models of reality, they inevitably
  contain errors introduced by projection, compilation, and
  symbolization
  (<xref alt="Lightfoot &amp; Butler, 1987" rid="ref-lightfootU003A1987" ref-type="bibr">Lightfoot
  &amp; Butler, 1987</xref>;
  <xref alt="Maling, 2013" rid="ref-malingU003A2013" ref-type="bibr">Maling,
  2013</xref>). Many issues originate in the production process itself.
  For example, satellite-based classifications (e.g., supervised or
  unsupervised workflows) can introduce errors of omission or
  commission, scale mismatches, or temporal misalignments with ground
  conditions
  (<xref alt="Schowengerdt, 2007" rid="ref-SchowengerdtU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Schowengerdt,
  2007</xref>). These limitations do not undermine the value of thematic
  maps; rather, they highlight the importance of rigorous quality
  assurance. Best practices include conducting formal accuracy
  assessments
  (<xref alt="Congalton &amp; Green, 2019" rid="ref-congaltonU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Congalton
  &amp; Green, 2019</xref>), transparently reporting error and
  uncertainty
  (<xref alt="MacEachren, 1992" rid="ref-maceachrenU003A1992" ref-type="bibr">MacEachren,
  1992</xref>), and, where appropriate, applying targeted
  post-classification corrections to address misclassifications
  (<xref alt="Manandhar et al., 2009" rid="ref-manandharU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Manandhar
  et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
  <p>The value of a thematic map ultimately depends on its quality,
  which is primarily driven by the original data sources and
  classification methodologies. However, post-classification correction
  serves as a widely adopted final step to refine misclassifications and
  improve outcomes. A common approach, particularly for remote
  sensing-based maps, involves integrating ancillary data and
  knowledge-based rules to resolve misclassifications, reduce commission
  errors, and enhance overall accuracy
  (<xref alt="Manandhar et al., 2009" rid="ref-manandharU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Manandhar
  et al., 2009</xref>;
  <xref alt="Thakkar et al., 2017" rid="ref-thakkarU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Thakkar
  et al., 2017</xref>). These corrections often rely on manual editing
  or semi-automated techniques guided by expert knowledge and reference
  data. This is precisely the context in which ThRasE was developed.</p>
  <p>Several tools offer raster editing and reclassification
  capabilities, including commercial packages such as ERDAS IMAGINE and
  ENVI with raster reclassification and pixel editing, and ArcGIS with
  its interactive pixel value manipulation tool. Open-source
  alternatives like GRASS GIS provide command-line reclassification, and
  the QGIS plugin Serval enables basic pixel-level raster modifications.
  While these tools support raster editing, none integrates synchronized
  multi-view comparison, systematic tile-based navigation, modification
  tracking, multiple editing tools, a recode table, and session
  persistence within a unified workflow.</p>
  <p>In Colombia, the Forest and Carbon Monitoring System (SMByC) of the
  Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM)
  is responsible for measuring and ensuring the accuracy of the official
  national forest figures. As part of the SMByC, we identified the need
  not only for review and editing capabilities but also for a dedicated
  tool to enable systematic and rigorous quality control of final
  products, thereby guaranteeing reliable results
  (<xref alt="Galindo et al., 2014" rid="ref-galindoU003A2014" ref-type="bibr">Galindo
  et al., 2014</xref>). To address this gap, we developed ThRasE, an
  open-source QGIS plugin that provides flexible editing, visual
  inspection, and auditable quality assurance workflows.</p>
  <p>ThRasE offers a suite of editing tools, a modification tracking
  registry, systematic visual inspection features, and comparison
  capabilities with reference data. By incorporating ancillary data and
  knowledge-based rules, ThRasE enables expert-guided manual editing,
  facilitating targeted corrections of misclassifications and
  fine-tuning of class assignments. ThRasE has been used for multiple
  purposes worldwide, including manual post-processing to correct
  land-use/land-cover misclassifications via photo-interpretation of
  satellite image mosaics

    <title>Multi-View Configuration</title>
    <p>ThRasE is designed to prioritize visual comparison. To that end,
    analysts can arrange multiple synchronized panels in a grid, with
    each panel blending up to three layers (for example, the target
    thematic raster, a reference product, and ancillary context) with
    independent opacity controls. Creating several panels with different
    layer combinations and opacity settings enables overlap inspection
    and side-by-side comparison, making it easier to spot boundary
    errors, edge artifacts, and local inconsistencies that are often
    missed when toggling a single map. This layout shortens the loop
    between detection and correction during post-classification editing
    and quality assurance.</p>

    <p>ThRasE provides pixel-level editing and bulk class recoding for
    fast, large-scale corrections. The Recode Pixel Table lets analysts
    define class-to-class mappings and apply them across the thematic
    map, enabling multiple classes to be updated in a single operation.
    Each view offers an editing toolset with options for pixel, line,
    polygon, and freehand drawing, supported by independent undo and
    redo actions per tool and per view. Analysts can initiate edits from
    any panel while targeting the thematic map, preserving full visual
    context during correction and facilitating precise, context-aware
    refinements.</p>

    <title>Modification Tracking System</title>
    <p>ThRasE includes a modification tracking system that records all
    edits to the thematic map during editing sessions. Every pixel
    change is recorded with its original value and timestamp, enabling a
    complete edit history and strong traceability for quality assurance.
    Modified areas can be highlighted on the canvas to provide immediate
    spatial feedback and help reveal patterns or missed regions during
    the editing process. By maintaining a comprehensive record of edits,
    the system supports quality assurance workflows where transparency
    and reproducibility are essential, allowing teams to verify
    corrections, trace decisions, and export change logs for
    documentation or peer review.</p>

  <sec id="systematic-inspection-navigator">
    <title>Systematic Inspection Navigator</title>
    <p>Systematic inspection is fundamental to quality assurance in
    thematic mapping. ThRasE provides a tile-based navigation tool that
    divides the area of interest within the thematic map into manageable
    units and sequences through tiles in a defined pattern to guarantee
    full spatial coverage. The navigation tool offers multiple
    configuration options, allowing teams to adapt their review strategy
    to data characteristics or geographic features. This structured
    approach transforms what could be an unstructured visual inspection
    into a methodical process, reducing the risk of missed areas and
    supporting complete spatial coverage during editing and quality
    control operations.</p>

  </sec>
  <sec id="session-persistence">
    <title>Session Persistence</title>
    <p>ThRasE supports session persistence through save and restore
    functionality that captures the complete workspace state. This
    capability proves essential for multi-session workflows where
    analysts need to maintain consistency across editing or review
    periods. Teams can share standardized configurations to ensure
    uniform inspection methodology across multiple operators, while
    individual analysts can resume work at the exact tile and visual
    context where they paused, preserving both spatial progress and
    workspace setup.</p>
