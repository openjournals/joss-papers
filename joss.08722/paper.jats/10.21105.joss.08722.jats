  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The movement of charge and energy is a fundamental process in
  materials science, underpinning technologies such as solar cells,
  light-emitting diodes, batteries, and electronics. Transport is well
  understood in both highly ordered materials (band conduction) and
  highly disordered ones (hopping conduction). However, in moderately
  disordered materials—including many organic semiconductors—transport
  lies in the intermediate transport regime between these
  well-understood extremes. Accurately modelling intermediate-regime
  conduction is difficult because describing wavefunction delocalisation
  requires a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, which is challenging in
  disordered materials that lack periodicity. We have previously
  developed delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo
  (<monospace>dKMC</monospace>), the first theoretical approach to
  treat, in three dimensions, all the processes crucial in organic
  semiconductors: disorder, delocalisation, and polaron formation. As a
  result, it can treat the intermediate transport regime between band
  and hopping conduction. <monospace>dKMC</monospace> reveals that the
  fundamental physics of transport in moderately disordered materials is
  that of charges and excitons hopping between partially delocalised
  electronic states. In this work, we release the
  <monospace>dKMC.jl</monospace> package, which contains modules for
  simulating the fundamental processes of charge and exciton transport
  as well as charge separation and generation.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The need for dKMC is demonstrated by its ability to solve two
  important problems.</p>
  <p>First, <monospace>dKMC</monospace> is the first computational
  technique that is able to include all of the processes crucial in
  organic semiconductors while remaining computationally tractable
  enough to treat realistic, three-dimensional systems on mesoscopic
  time and length scales
  (<xref alt="Balzer et al., 2021" rid="ref-Balzer2021" ref-type="bibr">Balzer
  et al., 2021</xref>). Before <monospace>dKMC</monospace>, the
  difficulty in modelling transport in the intermediate regime had
  prevented the development of such a theory. Instead, prior approaches
  either needed to exclude one of the key ingredients (disorder,
  delocalisation, and polaron formation), which could lead to inaccurate
  results, or included them all but restricted the application to
  smaller systems (dimension, time, and length scales).
  <monospace>dKMC</monospace> solves these problems, striking a balance
  between the level of approximation and the size of the system it can
  simulate. Therefore, <monospace>dKMC</monospace> provides a simulation
  tool that can both accurately and efficiently simulate fundamental
  transport processes involving partially delocalised carriers.</p>
  <p>Second, <monospace>dKMC</monospace> explains the often confusing
  behaviour of organic electronics, including organic photovoltaics
  (OPVs). Most models of transport in disordered organic semiconductors
  assume hopping transport, where charge carriers or excitons are
  localised onto individual molecules and move via thermally assisted
  hops from one molecule to the next. However, hopping transport fails
  to explain how charges and excitons move as fast as they do, or how
  charges in OPVs overcome their strong Coulomb attraction and separate
  from CT (charge transfer) states as efficiently as they do, or how
  charges are generated so efficiently even in OPV devices with little
  to no energetic offsets. Hopping transport fails because, in many
  organic semiconductors, the charges and excitons remain delocalised
  across multiple molecules. By going beyond hopping,
  <monospace>dKMC</monospace> reveals that delocalisation improves each
  of the four fundamental transport processes in OPVs: charge transport
  (<xref alt="Balzer et al., 2021" rid="ref-Balzer2021" ref-type="bibr">Balzer
  et al., 2021</xref>), exciton transport
  (<xref alt="Balzer &amp; Kassal, 2023" rid="ref-Balzer2023" ref-type="bibr">Balzer
  &amp; Kassal, 2023</xref>), charge separation
  (<xref alt="Balzer &amp; Kassal, 2022" rid="ref-Balzer2022" ref-type="bibr">Balzer
  &amp; Kassal, 2022</xref>), and charge generation
  (<xref alt="Balzer &amp; Kassal, 2024" rid="ref-Balzer2024" ref-type="bibr">Balzer
  &amp; Kassal, 2024</xref>). Delocalisation improves all of these
  important transport processes in essentially the same way, by enabling
  carriers to hop further and faster, explaining the failure of
  classical theories. Therefore, <monospace>dKMC</monospace> is a tool
  for explaining the otherwise unpredictable behaviour observed in
  devices.</p>
  <p><monospace>dKMC</monospace> was developed for organic
  semiconductors, but it can be more generally applied to other
  materials that lie in the intermediate regime. In particular, the
  first application of <monospace>dKMC</monospace> was to OPVs and
  therefore the package contains a module for each of the four
  fundamental processes in OPVs: charge transport, exciton transport,
  charge separation, and charge generation. However, the transport
  modules can be more generally applied to organic semiconductor
  materials used in other devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes
  or organic field-effect transistors.</p>
