  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>ClusterValidityIndices.jl is a Julia package for evaluating the
  performance of clustering algorithms without the aid of supervised
  labels. Cluster Validity Indices (CVI) provide a metric of the over-
  or under-partitioning of an arbitrary clustering algorithm with only
  the original data and labels assigned by the clustering algorithm.
  Furthermore, there exist formulations of every CVI such that they may
  run incrementally (i.e. Incremental CVIs, or ICVI), streaming
  alongside the clustering algorithm and producing the same results as
  in their batch implementations. Using a standard interface, each CVI
  in this package can be run with any clustering algorithm to produce a
  metric of that algorithm’s performance in scenarios where explicit
  supervised labels do not exist, which is extremely useful in
  real-world applications where that is often the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>CVIs are useful as one of the only methods of determining the
  performance of a clustering algorithm in the absence of explicit
  labels
  (<xref alt="Arbelaitz et al., 2013" rid="ref-ARBELAITZ2013243" ref-type="bibr">Arbelaitz
  et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ICVIs can measure the performance
  of clustering algorithms as they are running in a computationally
  tractable manner, which is incredibly useful in a variety of streaming
  clustering applications
  (<xref alt="Brito Da Silva et al., 2020" rid="ref-brito_da_silva_incremental_2020" ref-type="bibr">Brito
  Da Silva et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
  <p>There exist many CVIs in the literature, and their algorithmic and
  programmatic requirements are often very similar. Despite their
  utility in machine learning applications, however, there does not
  exist to date a unified repository of their implementations in Julia.
  Furthermore, new incremental variations of these algorithms are
  regularly developed in the literature without the ability to update
  the original implementations. The purpose of this package is to create
  a unified framework and repository of CVIs so as to fill the gap left
  by most metrics in this machine learning problem subset.</p>
  <sec id="target-audience">
    <title>Target Audience</title>
    <p>This package is principally intended as a resource for
    researchers in machine learning, clustering, and the research fields
    that utilize these tools to other ends, such as the statistical
    analysis of time series. However, implementing these algorithms in
    the Julia programming language brings all of the benefits of Julia
    itself, such as the computational speed comparable to that of being
    implemented in a low-level language such as C while having the
    syntactic transparency of a high-level language such as MATLAB or
    Python. Being implemented in Julia allows this package to be
    understood and expanded upon by research scientists while also being
    able to be used in resource-demanding production environments.</p>

    <title>Comparison to Existing Implementations</title>
    <p>Many implementations of various CVIs exist as a result of
    reproducibility efforts in the literature for use by the machine
    learning research community. However, each of these implementations
    vary in degrees of programming accessibility, language, number of
    implemented CVIs, and incremental variant implementations. Due to
    gaps left by the incomplete feature overlap of existing CVI
    packages, the objective of this package is to make many batch and
    incremental CVIs available in a fast, free, open-source, and
    documented repository.</p>
    <p>Researchers associated with the CRIStAL Laboratory of the
    University of Lille, France have implemented a CVI package in the
    MATLAB programming language for the reproducibility of a survey of
    CVIs
    (<xref alt="José-Garcı́a, 2021" rid="ref-cvik-toolbox-GitHub" ref-type="bibr">José-Garcı́a,
    2021</xref>;
    <xref alt="José-Garcı́a &amp; Gómez-Flores, 2021" rid="ref-CVI_Survey_Garcia" ref-type="bibr">José-Garcı́a
    &amp; Gómez-Flores, 2021</xref>). This repository contains a large
    variety of CVIs from the literature, though they are lacking their
    incremental variants.</p>
    <p>A variety of CVIs are also implemented in a package for time
    series clustering in the R statistical computing language
    (<xref alt="Sarda-Espinosa, 2022" rid="ref-R_dtwclust" ref-type="bibr">Sarda-Espinosa,
    2022</xref>). However, these CVIs are implemented as a submodule of
    the R package rather than being standalone, impeding their
    visibility, and incremental variants are also not implemented.</p>
    <p>Although each of these CVI projects and the very many and
    disparate implementations of individual CVIs in the literature
    combined may implement the majority of CVI algorithms relevant to
    modern research and engineering, together they lack cohesion in
    programming language and usage. Furthermore, though software
    implementations in the MATLAB programming language are syntactically
    accessible, this is to the detriment of those in research and
    industry without a private MATLAB license. In contrast, the R
    programming language is open and extremely powerful for research
    scientists and statisticians yet generally less suited for
    production environments.</p>
    <p>The Julia programming langauge is selected for this open-source
    CVI package implementation due to its high-level syntactic ease of
    use and speed of development without comprimising computational
    efficiency for production environments. Furthermore, the objective
    of this package is to contain both batch and incremental
    implementations of many CVIs with clear documentation and simple
    usage for research scientists and engineers alike.</p>

  <title>Cluster Validity Indices</title>
  <p>Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs) are designed to tackle the problem
  of creating a metric of performance for unsupervised algorithms where
  the true answer is unknown. Clustering is a ubiquitous unsupervised
  learning paradigm, so the terminology and development of CVIs
  principally target clustering algorithms.</p>
  <p>Because the clustering problem statement means that one does not
  have true labels to measure how well or poorly these algorithms
  perform, the most that can be done is to create a metric of the
  validity of the solution. This translates to how much an algorithm
  over- or under-partitions the data (i.e., how eager or reticent it is
  to create new categories) and quantifies how the algorithm structures
  its solution in its compactness (i.e., the density of the prescribed
  cluster regions) and its connectedness (i.e., how much disparate
  points in a cluster can be said to still belong to the same
  category).</p>
  <p>In general, CVIs take a set of samples and the labels prescribed to
  them by a clustering algorithm, and they return a criterion value that
  is generally a positive real number. This criterion value often does
  not have an upper bound, varies greatly in behavior between CVIs, and
  changes as new samples are labeled and the CVI is reprocessed. In
  fact, it is often the trendlines of these values that provide the most
  information about the clustering process rather than the values
  themselves.</p>
  <p>CVIs are originally derived to work on batches of samples and
  labels. However, there exist incremental variants that are proven to
  be mathematically equivalent to their batch counterparts
  (<xref alt="Brito Da Silva et al., 2020" rid="ref-brito_da_silva_incremental_2020" ref-type="bibr">Brito
  Da Silva et al., 2020</xref>). These incremental CVIs (ICVIs) mitigate
  the computational overhead of computing these metrics online, such as
  in a streaming clustering scenarios.</p>
