  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>MAT-dp is a Python model which aims to calculate the amounts and
  types of materials needed for building any system or resource
  transformation including those found along any supply chain- but is
  particularly applied to studying the materials needed for building
  low-carbon systems- and estimate the environmental implications
  associated to such materials.</p>
  <p>Mat-dp contains a linear programming library called mat-dp-core
  which includes the core classes of each element and their mathematical
  operations for obtaining results. Mat-dp-core is tailored to the needs
  of research around material demand for low-carbon systems, helping
  technically proficient users to explore scenarios and systems relating
  to their research in Python. Mat-dp-core has an easy-to-use structure
  and code base with the mathematical model to let users evaluate and
  optimise the environmental effects of a given set of resources that
  are fed into one or more processes.</p>
  <p>In mat-dp-core, the system and its required materials are defined
  as a series of resources that are fed into different processes, which
  in turn have a defined set of outputs. The outputs can be the result
  of the process, e.g., energy, materials or greenhouse gas emissions.
  The system can then be optimised using an objective function related
  to a property of the system which will be minimised (e.g., number of
  runs or cost) subject to three possible types of constraints built
  into mat-dp-core, depending on the desired output of the process,
  e.g., a required electricity capacity of an offshore wind
  installation. The three types of constraints that can be defined are:
  a given ratio of process runs (Run Ratio Constraint), a given number
  of resources produced (Resource Constraint), and a given number of
  process runs (Run Eq Constraint) that the system has to comply with.
  The model results obtained can then be exported and further
  explored.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Materials are essential for creating the systems used in everyday
  life, yet, manufacturing materials emits important quantities of
  greenhouse gases (GHG). Emissions from material production have been
  estimated to increase from 5 gigatons (Gt) of CO2-equivalent to 11 Gt
  between 1995 and 2015. In turn, global emissions due to material
  production rose from 15 per cent to 23 per cent in the same period
  (<xref alt="Hertwich et al., 2020" rid="ref-Hertwich2020" ref-type="bibr">Hertwich
  et al., 2020</xref>), while materials are estimated to contribute to
  over half of GHG emissions from industry
  (<xref alt="Allwood et al., 2010" rid="ref-Allwood2010" ref-type="bibr">Allwood
  et al., 2010</xref>).
  Thus, identifying and implementing options for reducing material
  emissions is required.</p>
  <p>Mat-dp offers an easy-to-use structure to study material demands,
  where the types of processes and resources can be extended as much as
  the user needs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
  that such an extensible open-source Python model to study materials
  has been developed. Previous models in the literature and other
  open-source models have focused on either only a subset of systems
  (e.g., materials for buildings) or a comprehensive, yet prescribed,
  set of systems which include some technologies and materials (e.g.,
  ODYM-RECC model
  (<xref alt="Pauliuk, 2020" rid="ref-Pauliuk2020" ref-type="bibr">Pauliuk,
  2020</xref>)). The reusable nature of Mat-dp makes it ideal for
  allowing users to focus on the process(es) they want to investigate,
  rather than setting up code or a mathematical model from scratch. The
  benefits of such reusability to advancing research in this scientific
  discipline cannot be understated.</p>
  <p>Mat-dp is capable of adapting the temporal and regional
  specifications of users by creating the processes according to
  prescribed names and using indices for the desired categories once the
  Mat-dp library has been imported to a working example. Mat-dp also
  allows for different material mixes, technology changes or
  improvements over time, and recycled material content in a given
  process to be included in the model. These capabilities allow for
  models to be built that are tailored for a specific case-study, which
  might benefit decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="target-audience">
  <title>Target Audience</title>
  <p>Mat-dp is ideal for academics who work on understanding or reducing
  environmental effects of different processes, government officials who
  work on national material and emission strategies, or practitioners
  who work on estimating material demands for a given project.
  Proficiency in Python is needed, so the users can adapt their
  requirements in the form needed for the model.</p>
  <p>The model facilitates the framing of resource flows and the
  optimisation of their flows in and out of systems which can then be
  easily visualised. This allows for users to explore alternative ways
  to build systems by either reducing or changing their inputs,
  maximising their outputs or by minimising their emissions or
  waste.</p>
  <p>Mat-dp has been used to study the environmental implications of
  electricity systems, where each power plant is considered a process in
  the model. However, these processes can be anything along any supply
  chain or resource transformation, as long as the user knows the
  resources that are fed into the processes. Examples of questions that
  can then be investigated by Mat-dp include: (1) what are the material
  implications of changing systems, (2) what are the optimum strategies
  to introduce recycled materials in a system, (3) which process
  emissions must be minimised to achieve the highest reductions?</p>
