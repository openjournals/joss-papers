  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Statistical causal inference of mixed exposures has been limited by
  reliance on parametric models and, until recently, by researchers
  considering only one exposure at a time, usually estimated as a beta
  coefficient in a generalized linear regression model (GLM). This
  independent assessment of exposures poorly estimates the joint impact
  of a collection of the same exposures in a realistic exposure setting.
  Marginal methods for mixture variable selection such as ridge/lasso
  regression are biased by linear assumptions and the interactions
  modeled are chosen by the user. Clustering methods such as principal
  component regression lose both interpretability and valid inference.
  Newer mixture methods such as quantile g-computation
  (<xref alt="Keil et al., 2020" rid="ref-keil2020quantile" ref-type="bibr">Keil
  et al., 2020</xref>) are biased by linear/additive assumptions. More
  flexible methods such as Bayesian kernel machine regression
  (BKMR)(<xref alt="Bobb et al., 2014" rid="ref-Bobb2014" ref-type="bibr">Bobb
  et al., 2014</xref>) are sensitive to the choice of tuning parameters,
  are computationally taxing and lack an interpretable and robust
  summary statistic of dose-response relationships. No methods currently
  exist which finds the best flexible model to adjust for covariates
  while applying a non-parametric model that targets for interactions in
  a mixture and delivers valid inference for a target parameter.
  Non-parametric methods such as decision trees are a useful tool to
  evaluate combined exposures by finding partitions in the
  joint-exposure (mixture) space that best explain the variance in an
  outcome. However, current methods using decision trees to assess
  statistical inference for interactions are biased and are prone to
  overfitting by using the full data to both identify nodes in the tree
  and make statistical inference given these nodes. Other methods have
  used an independent test set to derive inference which does not use
  the full data. The <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace>
  <monospace>R</monospace> package provides researchers in
  (bio)statistics, epidemiology, and environmental health sciences with
  access to state-of-the-art statistical methodology for evaluating the
  causal effects of a data-adaptively determined mixed exposure using
  decision trees. Our target audience are those analysts who would
  normally use a potentially biased GLM based model for a mixed
  exposure. Instead, we hope to provide users with a non-parametric
  statistical machine where users simply specify the exposures,
  covariates and outcome, <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> then
  determines if a best fitting decision tree exists and delivers
  interpretable results.</p>
  <p>Although users do not need strong knowledge of the underlying
  theory, <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> builds off the general
  theorem of cross-validated minimum loss-based estimation (CV-TMLE)
  which allows for the full utilization of loss-based ensemble machine
  learning to obtain the initial estimators needed for our target
  parameter without risk of overfitting.
  <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> uses V-fold cross-validation and
  partitions the full data into parameter-generating samples and
  estimation samples. For example, when V=10, integers 1-10 are randomly
  assigned to each observation with equal probability. In fold 1,
  observations assigned to 1 are used in the estimation sample and all
  other observations are used in the parameter-generating sample. This
  process rotates through the data until all the folds are complete. In
  the parameter-generating sample, decision trees are applied to a mixed
  exposure to obtain rules and estimators are created for our
  statistical target parameter. The rules from decision trees are then
  applied to the estimation sample where the statistical target
  parameter is estimated. <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> makes
  possible the non-parametric estimation of the causal effects of a
  mixed exposure producing results that are both interpretable and
  guaranteed to converge to the truth (under assumptions) at a
  particular rate as sample size increases. Additionally,
  <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> allows for discovery of important
  mixtures of exposure <italic>and also</italic> provides robust
  statistical inference for the impact of these mixtures.</p>

<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>In many disciplines there is a demonstrable need to ascertain the
  causal effects of a mixed exposure. Advancement in the area of mixed
  exposures is challenged by real-world joint exposure scenarios where
  complex agonistic or antagonistic relationships between mixture
  components can occur. More flexible methods which can fit these
  interactions may be less biased, but results are typically difficult
  to interpret, which has led researchers to favor more biased methods
  based on GLM’s. Current software tools for mixtures rarely report
  performance tests using data that reflect the complexities of
  real-world exposures
  (<xref alt="Carlin et al., 2013" rid="ref-carlin2013unraveling" ref-type="bibr">Carlin
  et al., 2013</xref>;
  <xref alt="Keil et al., 2020" rid="ref-keil2020quantile" ref-type="bibr">Keil
  et al., 2020</xref>;
  <xref alt="Yu et al., 2022" rid="ref-Yu2022" ref-type="bibr">Yu et
  al., 2022</xref>). In many instances, new methods are not tested
  against a ground-truth target parameter under various mixture
  conditions. New areas of statistical research, rooted in
  non/semi-parametric efficiency theory for statistical functionals,
  allow for robust estimation of data-adaptive parameters. That is, it
  is possible to use the data to both define and estimate a target
  parameter. This is important in mixtures when the most important set
  of variables and levels in these variables are almost always unknown.
  Thus, the development of asymptotically linear estimators for
  data-adaptive parameters are critical for the field of mixed exposure
  statistics. However, the development of open-source software which
  translates semi-parametric statistical theory into well-documented
  functional software is a formidable challenge. Such implementation
  requires understanding of causal inference, semi-parametric
  statistical theory, machine learning, and the intersection of these
  disciplines. The <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace>
  <monospace>R</monospace> package provides researchers with an
  open-source tool for evaluating the causal effects of a mixed exposure
  by treating decision trees as a data-adaptive target parameter to
  define exposure. The <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> package is well
  documented and includes a vignette detailing semi-parametric theory
  for data-adaptive parameters, examples of output, results with
  interpretations under various real-life mixture scenarios, and
  comparison to existing methods.</p>

<sec id="background">
  <title>Background</title>
  <p>In many research scenarios, the analyst is interested in causal
  inference for an <italic>a priori</italic> specified treatment or
  exposure. This is because when a single exposure/treatment is measured
  the analyst is interested in understanding how this exposure/treatment
  impacts an outcome, controlling for covariates. However, in the
  evaluation of a mixed exposure, such as air pollution or pesticides,
  it is not possible to estimate the expected outcome given every
  combination of exposures. This is because the conditional outcome
  given every combination of exposures is not measured. Furthermore, it
  is likely that, only certain exposures within a mixture have marginal
  or interacting effects on an outcome. In such a setting, new methods
  are needed for statistical learning from data that go beyond the usual
  requirement that the estimand is <italic>a priori</italic> defined in
  order to allow for proper statistical inference
  (<xref alt="Hubbard et al., 2016" rid="ref-Hubbard2016" ref-type="bibr">Hubbard
  et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of mixtures, it is necessary to map
  a set of continuous mixture components into a lower dimensional
  representation of exposure using a pre-determined algorithm, and then
  estimate a target parameter on this more interpretable exposure.
  Decision trees provide a useful solution by mapping a set of exposures
  into a rule which can be represented as a binary vector. This binary
  vector indicates whether an individual has been exposed to a
  particular rule estimated by the decision tree. Our target parameter
  is then defined as the mean difference in counterfactual outcomes for
  those exposed to the mixture subspace (delineated by the rule)
  compared to those unexposed, or the average treatment effect (ATE) for
  the mixed exposure. Decision trees have been used as a data-adaptive
  parameter to explore and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of a
  binary treatment
  (<xref alt="Athey &amp; Imbens, 2016" rid="ref-Athey2016" ref-type="bibr">Athey
  &amp; Imbens, 2016</xref>). Using a so-called “honest” approach, this
  method estimates the treatment effect in subpopulations based on
  covariates in a left-out sample. This approach is limited by not
  making use of the full data and not data-adaptively selecting the best
  decision tree. Advancements in using decision trees as a data-adaptive
  parameter that solve both these issues and guarantees nominal
  confidence interval coverage under certain assumptions are needed.
  Under normal assumptions of conditional independence (A is independent
  of Y given W) and positivity (enough experimentation in the data)
  identifiability of the ATE causal parameter is obtained from the
  observed data via the statistical functional for a data adaptively
  determined exposure. This is because, 1. by using Super Learner as our
  estimator, we are asymptotically guaranteed to select the correct
  functional for the underlying joint distribution thereby removing bias
  due to model error and 2. by using TMLE we debias our initial
  counterfactual for the ATE to target the parameter of interest. The
  remaining potential bias is therefore due to aggregated data and not
  the statistical method.</p>

  <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> is a novel approach for estimating
  the joint impact of a mixed exposure by using cross-validated targeted
  minimum loss-based estimation which guarantees consistency,
  efficiency, and multiple robustness despite using highly flexible
  learners to estimate a data-adaptive parameter.
  <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> summarizes the effect of a joint
  exposure on the outcome of interest by first doing an iterative
  backfitting procedure, similar to generalized additive models, to fit
  f(A), a Super Learner of decision trees, and h(W), an unrestricted
  Super Learner, in a semi-parametric model; E(Y|A,W) = f(A) + h(W),
  where A is a vector of exposures and W is a vector of covariates. In
  this way, we can data-adaptively find the best fitting decision tree
  model which has the lowest cross-validated model error while flexibly
  adjusting for covariates. This procedure is done to find rules for the
  mixture modeled collectively and for each mixture component
  individually. There are two types of results, 1. an ATE comparing
  those who fall within a subspace of the joint exposure versus those in
  the complement of that space and 2. the ATE for each data-adaptively
  identified threshold of an individual mixture component when compared
  to the lowest identified exposure level. The
  <monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> software package, for
  <monospace>R</monospace>
  (<xref alt="R Core Team, 2020" rid="ref-R" ref-type="bibr">R Core
  Team, 2020</xref>), implements this methodology for deriving causal
  inference from ensemble decision trees.</p>
  <p><monospace>CVtreeMLE</monospace> is designed to provide analysts
  with both V-fold specific and pooled results for ATE causal effects of
  a joint exposure determined by decision trees. It integrates with the
