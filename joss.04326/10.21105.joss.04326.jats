  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) plays a key role in the
  global carbon cycle and global warming. Climate-carbon feedbacks are
  often studied and estimated using Earth System Models (ESMs), which
  couple together multiple model components—including the atmosphere,
  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and cryosphere—to jointly simulate mass
  and energy exchanges within and between these components. Despite
  tremendous advances, model intercomparisons and benchmarking are
  aspects of ESMs that warrant further improvement
  (<xref alt="Fer et al., 2021" rid="ref-Fer2021gcb" ref-type="bibr">Fer
  et al., 2021</xref>;
  <xref alt="Smith et al., 2014" rid="ref-Smith2014ams" ref-type="bibr">Smith
  et al., 2014</xref>). Such benchmarking is critical because comparing
  the value of state variables in these simulations against observed
  values provides evidence for appropriately refining model components;
  moreover, researchers can learn much about Earth system dynamics in
  the process
  (<xref alt="Randall et al., 2019" rid="ref-Randall2019c" ref-type="bibr">Randall
  et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
  <p>We introduce <monospace>gdess</monospace> (a.k.a., Greenhouse gas
  Diagnostics for Earth System Simulations), which parses observational
  datasets and ESM simulation output, combines them to be in a
  consistent structure, computes statistical metrics, and generates
  diagnostic visualizations. In its current incarnation,
  <monospace>gdess</monospace> facilitates evaluating a model’s ability
  to reproduce observed temporal and spatial variations of atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub>. The diagnostics implemented modularly in
  <monospace>gdess</monospace> support more rapid assessment and
  improvement of model-simulated global CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks
  associated with land and ocean ecosystem processes. We intend for this
  set of automated diagnostics to form an extensible, open source
  framework for future comparisons of simulated and observed
  concentrations of various greenhouse gases across Earth system
  models.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Thorough evaluation of simulated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentrations—by comparing against observations—requires multiple
  diagnostics, metrics, and visualizations. During the past decade, such
  evaluations have utilized certain common methods, such as aggregating
  in situ measurements into latitude bands and detrending of
  multidecadal time series to investigate seasonal cycles

  <xref alt="Weir et al., 2021" rid="ref-WeirEtAl2021acp" ref-type="bibr">Weir
  et al., 2021</xref>). However, the construction of diagnostics used in
  these evaluations has not been automated in an open-source tool
  available to the broader atmospheric modeling community. Thus, each
  modeling or analysis team has had to decide on and code their own
  preferred set of diagnostics, resulting in redundancies and potential
  inconsistencies among efforts.</p>
  <p>Several software packages have been developed to streamline the
  application of diagnostics for ESM benchmarking. These tools share
  related functionality with <monospace>gdess</monospace>, and some have
  directly inspired the <monospace>gdess</monospace> design and our
  development approach. For example, the ESM Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool; Eyring, Righi, et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-Eyring2016c" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>);
  Eyring et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-Eyring2020b" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>))
  has been used to generate specific figures from the literature, and we
  adopted the term <italic>recipe</italic> from its use by ESMValTool.
  Although ESMValTool includes a comparison of column-averaged
  CO<sub>2</sub> values as performed by Gier et al. (2020),
  <monospace>gdess</monospace> was created to provide specific
  CO<sub>2</sub> diagnostic methods and graphs that are not already
  provided as recipes in ESMValTool. <monospace>gdess</monospace> uses
  Observation Package (Obspack; Schuldt et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-globalview20200911" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>);

  (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-Masarie2014b" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>))
  data, which include atmospheric greenhouse gas observations from a
  variety of sampling platforms and data providers following the World
  Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) protocol, so are widely used
  for stimulating and supporting carbon cycle modeling studies. These
  data have not been set up for use within ESMValTool, and as such would
  require additional development/configuration to work with ESMValTool.
  The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) System
  (<xref alt="Collier et al., 2018" rid="ref-Collier2018a" ref-type="bibr">Collier
  et al., 2018</xref>) excels at intercomparisons between multiple land
  models and has been used to benchmark inferred CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentrations against surface station measurements
  (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2020" rid="ref-WuEtAl2020jhydro" ref-type="bibr">Wu

  ILAMB provides the means to evaluate emulated results but not
  prognostic simulations for CO<sub>2</sub>

  is a global modeling system composed of multiple coupled subcomponent

  <p>CMIP6 organizes the setup, experimental design, and

  package, which is a <monospace>gdess</monospace> dependency maintained
  as part of the <italic>Pangeo</italic> project. By default,
  comparisons in <monospace>gdess</monospace> use data from the
  ‘esm-hist’ experiment, which contains CO<sub>2</sub> emission-driven
  simulations that span the period of 1850 to 2014—i.e., an “all-forcing
  simulation of the recent past with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentration calculated”
  (<xref alt="Eyring, Bony, et al., 2016" rid="ref-Eyring2016d" ref-type="bibr">Eyring,

  <p>This section describes and provides example output from the three

  recipes can be initiated either from a terminal or from within a

  <monospace>gdess</monospace> command, followed by the type of recipe,
  and then options for each recipe—e.g., which observing station(s) to
  use for comparison. Within a Python kernel, options are specified via
  a dictionary object.</p>

    <p>Skillful simulation of the historical multidecadal trend in
    atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a necessary condition for an ESM to be
    an effective tool for conducting climatological projections and
    analyses. The research questions one might address with this
    diagnostic recipe (see example output in
    <xref alt="Figure 3" rid="figU003Asurface_trend">Figure 3</xref>)

    to surface measurements?</p>

    <title>Seasonal cycle</title>
    <p>Because of the substantial impact primary production and
    respiration have on CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, evaluating the
    seasonal cycle at a given location can help disentangle the effects
    of biological from physical processes. The seasonal cycle can be
    quantified by “the projection of an atmospheric time series onto a
    suitably defined subset of orthogonal basis functions, the choice of
    which depends on the length of the series involved”
    (<xref alt="Straus, 1983" rid="ref-Straus1983ams" ref-type="bibr">Straus,
    1983</xref>). For computing the seasonal cycle, we detrend the time
    series by fitting a function composed of both polynomial and
    harmonic terms, following the procedure of Sweeney et al.
    (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-Sweeney2015b" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>)
    and originally proposed by Thoning &amp; Tans

    <p>By comparing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across observing sites

    the surface CO<sub>2</sub> flux signals at lower latitudes (30-45N)
    are moved to northern boreal latitudes and also to the south by
    large scale circulation. Spatial analysis can reveal evidence of
    southward movement toward (sub)tropical convection that becomes
    mixed with Hadley circulation or northward movement toward
    midlatitude synoptic weather patterns and the Ferrell circulation
