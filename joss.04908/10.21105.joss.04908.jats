  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Kraken and KrakenUniq are widely-used tools for classifying
  metagenomics sequences. A key requirement for these systems is a
  database containing all <italic>k-mers</italic> from all genomes that
  the users want to be able to detect, where <italic>k</italic> = 31 by
  default. This database can be very large, easily exceeding 100
  gigabytes (GB) and sometimes 400 GB. Previously, Kraken and KrakenUniq
  required loading the entire database into main memory (RAM), and if
  RAM was insufficient, they used memory mapping, which significantly
  increased the running time for large datasets. We have implemented a
  new algorithm in KrakenUniq that allows it to load and process the
  database in chunks, with only a modest increase in running time. This
  enhancement now makes it feasible to run KrakenUniq on very large
  datasets and huge databases on virtually any computer, even a laptop,
  while providing the same very high classification accuracy as the
  previous system.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>KrakenUniq software classifies reads from metagenomic samples to
  establish which organisms are present in the samples and estimate
  their abundance. The software is widely-used used by researchers and
  clinicians in medical diagnostics, microbiome and environmental
  studies.</p>
  <p>Typical databases used by KrakenUniq are tens to hundreds of
  gigabytes in size. The original KrakenUniq code required loading the
  entire database in RAM, which demanded expensive high-memory servers
  to run it efficiently. If a user did not have enough physical RAM to
  load the entire database, KrakenUniq resorted to memory-mapping the
  database, which significantly increased run times, frequently by a
  factor of more than 100. The new functionality described in this paper
  enables users who do not have access to high-memory servers to run
  KrakenUniq efficiently, with a CPU time performance increase of 3 to
  4-fold, down from 100+.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>The GenBank genome repository
  (<xref alt="Benson et al., 2012" rid="ref-benson2012genbank" ref-type="bibr">Benson
  et al., 2012</xref>) currently contains over 400,000 prokaryotic
  genomes and over 20,000 eukaryotes, including thousands of microbial
  eukaryotes such as fungi and protists. To take advantage of this
  ever-growing variety of microbial sequences, metagenomic sequence
  analysis methods must create customized databases that capture all of
  this sequence diversity. Tools such as Kraken
  (<xref alt="Wood &amp; Salzberg, 2014" rid="ref-wood2014kraken" ref-type="bibr">Wood
  &amp; Salzberg, 2014</xref>) and KrakenUniq
  (<xref alt="Breitwieser et al., 2018" rid="ref-breitwieser2018krakenuniq" ref-type="bibr">Breitwieser
  et al., 2018</xref>) classify DNA or RNA sequencing reads against a
  pre-built database of genomes using an exact <italic>k-mer</italic>
  matching strategy that is not only highly accurate but that, because
  it avoids the step of sequence alignment, makes both systems extremely
  fast.</p>
  <p>The Kraken database is a customized, compressed data structure that
  associates a unique taxonomy identifier with every single
  <italic>k-mer</italic> in every genome in the database. (Note that
  both Kraken and KrakenUniq use the same database design, so we will
  refer to both as Kraken databases.) If a <italic>k-mer</italic> occurs
  in two or more genomes, then the database stores the taxonomy ID
  associated with the lowest common ancestor of those genomes. This
  strategy means that only a single ID is attached to each
  <italic>k-mer</italic>.</p>
  <p>However, with the number of genomes available today, a standard
  Kraken database will contain billions of <italic>k-mers</italic>, and
  even with careful compression this data structure can grow very large.
  A key requirement for the speed of the Kraken algorithm (which is 900
  times faster than MegaBlast
  (<xref alt="Wood &amp; Salzberg, 2014" rid="ref-wood2014kraken" ref-type="bibr">Wood
  &amp; Salzberg, 2014</xref>)) is the loading of the entire database
  into main memory. For the large databases and read datasets that are
  commonly used in metagenomics experiments today, this requires
  dedicated machines with large amounts of RAM (e.g., exceeding 100 GB
  or even 400 GB), without which classification becomes slow and
  impractical. The newer Kraken2 system
  (<xref alt="Wood et al., 2019" rid="ref-wood2019improved" ref-type="bibr">Wood
  et al., 2019</xref>) achieves a significantly lower memory footprint
  by using probabilistic data structures to reduce the database size, at
  the cost of slightly lower accuracy than KrakenUniq. This reduction in
  accuracy includes a very small but non-zero false positive rate (i.e.,
  where the system incorrectly reports that a <italic>k-mer</italic> is
  present in a particular genome), which is problematic for certain
  applications that require very high precision. In particular, when
  metagenomic sequencing is used for the diagnosis of infections in a
  clinical setting
  (<xref alt="Salzberg et al., 2016" rid="ref-salzberg-pardo2016" ref-type="bibr">Salzberg
  et al., 2016</xref>), the pathogen of interest might be detected from
  just a handful of reads. In that scenario, even a few false positives
  can be confusing, and KrakenUniq is the preferred method rather than
  Kraken2.</p>
  <p>By default, KrakenUniq performs memory mapping to load the
  database; i.e., it does not load the entire database into main memory.
  (Kraken 1 employs the same strategy.) This makes classification of
  larger read datasets much slower, but it allows KrakenUniq to run on
  machines with low available main memory. If enough free RAM is
  available to hold the entire database in main memory, users are
  recommended to explicitly load the entire database prior to
  classification using the flag <monospace>--preload</monospace>, which
  dramatically speeds up the classification (see <bold>Table
  1</bold>).</p>
  <p>To improve KrakenUniq’s performance when not enough main memory is
  available to load the entire database into RAM, we have added a new
  capability to KrakenUniq, which we call database chunking. This new
  feature is released in KrakenUniq v1.0.0 and subsequent releases at:
  https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq (Github)
  https://anaconda.org/bioconda/krakenuniq (Conda)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="database-chunking">
  <title>Database chunking</title>
  <p>The KrakenUniq database consists of two tables: A
  <italic>k-mer</italic> table maps each <italic>k-mer</italic> to its
  taxonomic ID and is sorted by the <italic>k-mers’</italic> minimizers
  (<xref alt="Roberts et al., 2004" rid="ref-roberts2004reducing" ref-type="bibr">Roberts
  et al., 2004</xref>). A second table, the minimizer table, is
  lexicographically sorted and maps each minimizer to the corresponding
  <italic>k-mers</italic> in the <italic>k-mer</italic> table which form
  a contiguous block. Hence, the database can be chunked by taking a
  chunk of the minimizer table and the corresponding range of the
  <italic>k-mer</italic> table that contains all <italic>k-mers</italic>
  for the selected minimizers.</p>
  <p>Under this new algorithm, KrakenUniq loads one chunk of the
  database into memory at a time. KrakenUniq performs a binary search on
  the minimizer table to find the largest minimizer such that the chunk
  of the minimizer table and the corresponding chunk of the
  <italic>k-mer</italic> table together use not more than the specified
  amount of memory. It then loads the chunk of the minimizer table and
  the corresponding chunk of the k-mer table and iterates over all of
  the reads provided as input. The code looks up all
  <italic>k-mers</italic> in the reads in the currently-loaded chunk of
  the database. The taxonomic IDs for the <italic>k-mers</italic> that
  matched a k-mer in the chunk (or placeholders for
  <italic>k-mers</italic> without a hit) are stored in a temporary file
  on disk for each read. With every chunk iteration, taxonomic IDs of
  newly found <italic>k-mers</italic> in the reads are appended to the
  temporary file. This process is repeated until the entire database has
  been processed. At this point the temporary file contains taxonomic
  IDs for all k-mers in the reads that matched any part of the database.
  KrakenUniq then reads the temporary file, collects
  <italic>k-mer</italic> hits for every read, and uses them to classify
  each read. Classification results will be identical to running in the
  default mode; i.e., database chunking does not alter the output.</p>
  <p>This new feature makes it feasible to run KrakenUniq on very large
  datasets and huge databases on virtually any computer, even a laptop,
  while providing exact classifications that are identical to those of
  KrakenUniq in its other modes. Users can employ this feature by using
  <monospace>--preload-size</monospace> to specify the amount of
  available main memory that they want to use for loading chunks of the
  database, e.g., <monospace>--preload-size 8G</monospace> or
  <monospace>--preload-size 500M</monospace>.</p>

  <p>Table 1: Running times for classifying 9.4 million reads (from a
  human eye metagenome, accession SRR12486990, available from NCBI at
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR12486990) with 8 threads using
  KrakenUniq in different modes. The database size was 392 GB, and it
  consisted of all complete bacterial, archeal, and viral genomes in
  RefSeq from 2020, 46 selected eukaryotic human pathogens
  (<xref alt="Lu &amp; Salzberg, 2018" rid="ref-lu2018removing" ref-type="bibr">Lu
  &amp; Salzberg, 2018</xref>)), as well the human genome and a
  collection of common vector sequences. The database is available for
  download at https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2 under the
  name EuPathDB46. The command lines used to measure the runtimes were
  <monospace>krakenuniq --db krakendb-2020-08-16-all_pluseupath --threads 24 --report-file report --output classify SRR12486990.fastq</monospace>
  with no additional options for default, and with addition of the
  preload option shown in the table for various preload sizes. in the
  database chunking experiments (using
  <monospace>–preload-size</monospace>) KrakenUniq loaded the database
  into RAM in 49, 25, 13 and 7 chunks (respectively).</p>
  <p>Running times can vary significantly depending on the type of
  storage (e.g., databases on network storage can take longer to load)
  and the size of the read dataset (i.e., classifying a small number of
  reads does not justify preloading the entire database, especially of
  fast storage). The speed of loading the database is not impacted by
  the <monospace>--preload-size</monospace> option because the database
  is still read in a linear way.
  Saving intermediate files from the chunks is done in the same way as
  in the original code.
  The only difference is that now classification results from all
  individual chunks are concatenated into a single file, which is read
  once all chunks are finished. <bold>Table 1</bold> shows that in a
  typical use case, even when the database does fit in RAM, loading the
  entire database (<monospace>--preload</monospace> option) is far
  faster than memory mapping (14 minutes versus 48 hours). Loading the
  database by chunks adds overhead because of the need to iterate over
  the reads multiple times, but is still comparable to pre-loading the
  entire database and highly recommended when not enough main memory is
  available. For example, limiting the database to 8G, which means it
  can be loaded even on a standard laptop computer, increased the
  running time only about 3.4-fold, even though the database was broken
  into 49 chunks. For large read datasets we expect that setting the
  <monospace>--preload</monospace> or
  <monospace>--preload-size</monospace> flag will always be faster than
  the default behavior of memory mapping. The format of the databases
  used by the new algorithm has not changed, hence all previously built
  databases for Kraken and KrakenUniq can be used.</p>
  <p>This feature has only been added to KrakenUniq, and not to Kraken,
  which is no longer actively maintained. Because KrakenUniq offers more
  features, shares the same implementation with Kraken and produces the
  same output, we highly recommend that users upgrade from Kraken to
  KrakenUniq.</p>
