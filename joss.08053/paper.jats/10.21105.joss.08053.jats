  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>A polymer sample contains a natural degree of variation in its
  structure and non-uniformity between its chains, which influences the
  bulk material properties of the sample. This innate heterogeneity is
  often disregarded in the <italic>in silico</italic> study of a polymer
  system, resulting in divergence from experiments. This paper presents
  SwiftPol, a user-guided Python software for the automated generation
  of polydisperse polymer ensembles which reproduce the heterogeneity
  observed in real materials.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>MD simulations of polymers are often performed with uniform
  idealized systems that do not capture the heterogeneity of their
  experimental counterparts. The result of this misalignment is
  non-convergence between MD-derived polymer properties and experimental
  data, and these MD simulations can overlook key components of polymer
  physics such as polydispersity and semi-crystallinity

  material properties such as glass transition temperature,
  hydrophobicity, and inherent viscosity are highly sensitive to
  variations in polydispersity, making it essential to account for this
  heterogeneity to capture the true physics of polymer systems

  molecular weight diversity, and put the onus on the user to generate
  an ensemble of polydisperse chain sequences prior to using their chain
  building functions. Polymatic
  (<xref alt="Abbott et al., 2013" rid="ref-abbott_polymatic_2013" ref-type="bibr">Abbott
  et al., 2013</xref>), an algorithm to simulate polymerization, can
  theoretically create polydisperse systems through its random bond
  formation scheme, but does not have to ability to simultaneously
  control other key attributes of polymers such as blockiness and
  monomer ratio. The python tool Hoobas
  (<xref alt="Girard et al., 2019" rid="ref-girard_hoobas_2019" ref-type="bibr">Girard
  et al., 2019</xref>) builds polydisperse systems of randomized polymer
  chains for coarse-grained models. However, there is not currently a
  software package available that contains in-built functions to
  integrate multiple smaller-scale characteristics (monomer ratio,
  blockiness, degree of polymerization, chain terminal) into
  <bold>atomistic</bold> computational polymer models, whilst
  effectively capturing the heterogeneity and polydispersity of
  real-life samples. The development of SwiftPol was driven by the need
  to fill this gap in multi-scale building functionality of existing
  polymer building packages, to enable the simulation of realistic
  polymer models whilst allowing close user control of multiple system
  characteristics.</p>
  <p>SwiftPol uses open-source Python libraries RDKit
  (<xref alt="Landrum et al., 2024" rid="ref-landrum_rdkitrdkit_2024" ref-type="bibr">Landrum
  et al., 2024</xref>), OpenFF-interchange
  (<xref alt="Thompson et al., 2024" rid="ref-thompson_openff_2024" ref-type="bibr">Thompson

  (<xref alt="Wagner et al., 2024" rid="ref-wagner_openforcefieldopenff-toolkit_2024" ref-type="bibr">Wagner
  et al., 2024</xref>) to promote reproducibility and portability. We
  have ensured that SwiftPol objects can be seamlessly integrated into
  existing open-source software built for parameterization and
  simulation, to allow the user to select their preferred force field,
  topology format, and engine. RDKit, OpenFF-interchange and
  OpenFF-toolkit enable the export of SwiftPol polymer ensembles
  directly to simulation engines, and to a range of MD-compatible file
  formats, including .pdb, .top, .prmtop, and .json.</p>
  <p>Here, we will detail the development of SwiftPol - a user-guided
  Python tool for building representative polymer ensembles, and
  subsequent studies to show its relevance and performance.</p>

<sec id="package-overview">
  <title>Package Overview</title>
  <p>The SwiftPol <monospace>build</monospace> module contains Python
  functions to build both single polymer chains and polydisperse polymer
  chain ensembles.</p>
  <p>SwiftPol takes as an input the simplified molecular-input
  line-entry system
  (SMILES)(<xref alt="Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc., 2022" rid="ref-daylight_chemical_information_systems_inc_daylight_2022-1" ref-type="bibr">Daylight
  Chemical Information Systems, Inc., 2022</xref>) string of all
  co-monomers, as well as values representing the target average
  properties of the ensemble: monomer % composition (for copolymers),
  length, number of chains, blockiness (for blocky copolymers),
  terminals, residual monomer. The user must define the reaction SMARTS
  (<xref alt="Daylight Chemical Information Systems, 2022" rid="ref-daylight_chemical_information_systems_inc_daylight_2022" ref-type="bibr">Daylight
  Chemical Information Systems, 2022</xref>) which describes the
  polymerization reaction associated with their polymer chemistry.</p>
  <p>As depicted in
  <xref alt="[Figure 1]" rid="FigureU00201">[Figure 1]</xref>, SwiftPol
  generates an initial polymer chain with a chain length drawn from a
  normal distribution centered around the specified target length, along
  with a terminal group that corresponds to the chosen input. In the
  case of a block copolymer, a probability function is used to determine
  the ratio of monomers in the chain and the chain is passed to a second
  function which tests whether the values for blockiness and % monomer
  are within 10% of the input variable by default. The +/- 10%
  acceptance margin introduces polydispersity into the ensemble by
  ensuring a certain level of non-uniformity between polymer chains,
  without straying too far from the input value. The acceptance margin
  can be adjusted by the user to control build stringency and
  polydispersity in the SwiftPol ensemble.</p>
  <p>If all tests are passed, the chain is appended to the Python
  polymer ensemble build object, and the associated properties of the
  chain are calculated and added as ensemble attributes. Otherwise, the
  chain is discarded, and the process is repeated. Once the ensemble
  size is satisfied, average properties are calculated using built-in
  SwiftPol functions.</p>

    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="Fig_1_Swiftpol.png" />
  </fig>
  <p>This approach allows for the generation of a polydisperse chain
  ensemble, meaning each chain displays different properties but the
  ensemble matches the target properties and distribution, as is
  observed in experimental polymer samples.</p>
  <p>SwiftPol also contains functions to generate conformers using RDKit
  (<xref alt="Landrum et al., 2024" rid="ref-landrum_rdkitrdkit_2024" ref-type="bibr">Landrum
  et al., 2024</xref>) or OpenEye Omega(license-dependent, academic

  parameters to the polydisperse ensembles using the openff-interchange
  infrastructure. The user can export the chain ensemble to existing
  tools such as packmol
  (<xref alt="Martínez et al., 2009" rid="ref-martinez_packmol_2009" ref-type="bibr">Martínez

  <title>Application: building a poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
  ensemble</title>
  <p>Using SwiftPol, we have successfully constructed polydisperse
  ensembles of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), a widely used
  biodegradable polymer. We used the molecular structures and properties
  of experimental PLGA products as input for SwiftPol building functions
  to create representative PLGA systems to be used for molecular
  dynamics simulations. By integrating experimental data, such as chain
  terminals, copolymer ratios of lactic and glycolic acid, and
  blockiness, we have been able to replicate the bulk characteristics of
  various commercial polymer products, namely polydispersity. A full
  example implementation of SwiftPol for building PLGA systems can be
  found in the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/matta-research-group/SwiftPol/blob/main/Example_Notebooks/PLGA_demo.ipynb">building
  a PLGA system example notebook.</ext-link> We used SwiftPol to build
  ‘product X’, a commercially available 75:25 LA:GA ester-terminated
  PLGA. Following the chain build, another SwiftPol function was used to
  calculate the appropriate box size for the unit cell, number of water
  molecules, NaCl ions, and residual monomer molecules to include in the
  simulation of a complete condensed polymer ensemble. The input values
  for the SwiftPol builder, seen in
  <xref alt="[tab:Table1]" rid="tabU003ATable1">[tab:Table1]</xref>,
  were taken from quality assurance documents provided by the
  manufacturer of product X, except the value for blockiness which was
  measured experimentally by Sun et al
  (<xref alt="Sun et al., 2022" rid="ref-sun_characterization_2022" ref-type="bibr">Sun

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>We presented SwiftPol, an open-source Python package for building
  polydisperse <italic>in silico</italic> polymer ensembles. SwiftPol
  recreates core characteristics of bulk polymer materials like
  polydispersity, enabling the simulation of representative systems that
  capture key components of polymer physics. We have shown that building
  longer chains and larger systems, exceeding what would be appropriate
  for atomistic MD simulations, will not create a time bottleneck in the
  MD workflow. SwiftPol is a robust and scalable tool for the guided
  generation of polydisperse polymer mixtures, which can be easily
  integrated into existing open-source MD software, such as the OpenFF
  toolkit.</p>
  <p>In future releases, we will expand SwiftPol to include options to
  control tacticity, provide in-package integration into
  widely-established packing software and offer a broader selection of
  solvation buffers.</p>
