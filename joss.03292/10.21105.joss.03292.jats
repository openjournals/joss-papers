  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid">repertory
  grid technique</ext-link> (often abbreviated as <italic>grid</italic>
  or <italic>repgrid</italic>) is a person-centered data collection
  method. It is primarily used in clinical psychology and generates a
  mix of qualitative and quantitative data. The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenRepGrid.ic/index.html"><monospace>OpenRepGrid.ic</monospace>
  R package</ext-link> presented here is a browser-based software to
  perform <italic>Interpretive Clustering</italic> (IC) for such data.
  IC is a method for clustering the attributes (so called constructs)
  resulting from a repertory grid interview by finding relational
  patterns between them. The IC method is described in detail in our
  recent publication
  (<xref alt="Burr et al., 2020" rid="ref-burr_qualitative_2020" ref-type="bibr">Burr
  et al., 2020</xref>). The package is part of the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openrepgrid.org/">OpenRepgrid
  project</ext-link>, which contains several software packages for the
  analysis of repertory grid data. In the following, we will briefly
  describe the repertory grid technique and provide a short example of
  how a grid dataset can be analyzed and interpreted using our
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenRepGrid.ic/index.html"><monospace>OpenRepGrid.ic</monospace></ext-link>
  software.</p>

<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Currently, the IC method is not implemented in any other existing
  repertory grid software. While IC can also be conducted by hand, this
  is very time consuming, error-prone and only feasible for small-sized
  grids. Hence, a software solution to support the IC procedure is
  needed. Without proper software support that facilitates the IC steps,
  the method is too laborious and is thus likely to become a
  methodological contribution which will rarely be used in research due
  to above mentioned reasons.</p>

<sec id="repertory-grid-technique">
  <title>Repertory Grid Technique</title>
  <p>The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a method which originated
  from <italic>Personal Construct Theory (PCT)</italic>
  (<xref alt="Kelly, 1955" rid="ref-kelly_psychology_1955" ref-type="bibr">Kelly,
  1955</xref>). It was originally designed as an instrument for clinical
  psychology but quickly spread to other disciplines like marketing,
  political, organizational, and educational research in the decades
  after its inauguration
  (<xref alt="Fransella et al., 2004" rid="ref-fransella_manual_2004" ref-type="bibr">Fransella
  et al., 2004</xref>). The RGT is a person-centered method which
  focuses on understanding how an individual sees, or in constructivist
  terms <italic>construes</italic>, the world. The data collected by the
  RGT is both, <italic>qualitative</italic> and
  <italic>quantitative</italic>. The qualitative part of the data
  consists of a list of bipolar attributes (e.g. <italic>light-hearted
  vs. depressed</italic>), which are elicited during the repertory grid
  interview. These attributes are called <italic>constructs</italic> in
  PCT terminology. Each construct consists of two
  <italic>poles</italic>, e.g. <italic>light-hearted</italic> and
  <italic>depressed</italic>, with the poles usually being opposites. In
  PCT, the constructs constitute the templates a person uses to construe
  a set of objects under consideration. These objects are called
  <italic>elements</italic> in PCT terminology and are, for example,
  persons, brands, countries, companies etc. In our example in Figure 1,
  the elements are a set of persons relevant to the grid interviewee,
  for example, <italic>father</italic>, <italic>mother</italic>,
  <italic>self</italic>, or <italic>ideal self</italic>. The
  quantitative part of a grid is generated by letting the interviewee
  assign a score (e.g. 0/1, or 1 to 6) to each element on each of
  his/her bipolar constructs. The result of the RGT is usually displayed
  as a constructs <italic>x</italic> elements matrix with the cells
  containing the ratings of each element on each construct. Figure 1
  shows a grid matrix where binary ratings (0/1) were used to assess the
  elements. For example, the element <italic>father</italic> received a
  score of 1 on the <italic>isolated = 0 vs. sociable = 1</italic>
  construct, indicating that the father is construed as sociable. The
  <italic>mother</italic>, in contrast, received a score of 0 and is
  thus construed as isolated. The grid matrix is the central result of
  the RGT and yields a) a set of bipolar constructs which are relevant
  to the person and b) an assessment of each element (persons in Figure
  1) on these dimensions. The white/red color coding in Figure 1
  additionally indicates which construct poles (white = left, red =
  right) apply and facilitates to identify similarities between
  elements. In its original form
  (<xref alt="Kelly, 1955" rid="ref-kelly_psychology_1955" ref-type="bibr">Kelly,
  1955</xref>) and in our example, grid ratings are binary (0/1), i.e.,
  each element is assigned to one construct pole. Nowadays, also scales
  with more grades (e.g. 1 to 6) are common. A general and more
  comprehensive introduction to the RGT can be found in Fransella et al.
  (<xref alt="2004" rid="ref-fransella_manual_2004" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p>

  <title>Interpretive Clustering</title>
  <p>IC is an idiographic method of interpretation which makes use of
  both, the qualitative and the quantitative grid data. In contrast to
  thematic analysis or content analysis, which could be used to identify
  themes in person’s elicited constructs (see
  <xref alt="Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006" rid="ref-braun_using_2006" ref-type="bibr">Braun
  &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>), IC identifies the relation between the
  constructs via quantitative assessment. By assessing the quantitative
  construct relations, implications which constructs hold for each other
  are identified. IC essentially identifies clusters of constructs which
  hold implications for each other. These clusters (or cliques) of
  constructs form the basis for a subsequent qualitative interpretation.
  We will provide a brief interpretation example below. The example
  builds on the analysis results the software generates as shown next.
  However, for a more thorough introduction to the IC method and
  comprehensive illustrations of interpretations, the reader is referred
  to our publication
  (<xref alt="Burr et al., 2020" rid="ref-burr_qualitative_2020" ref-type="bibr">Burr
  et al., 2020</xref>). Please note that the IC method only allows for
  binary grid ratings.</p>

  <title>Running the software</title>
  <p>The package can be downloaded from the CRAN repository via the R
  command
  <monospace>install.packages(&quot;OpenRepGrid.ic&quot;)</monospace>.
  The software is then started as follows.</p>
  <code language="r script">library(OpenRepGrid.ic)
ic()</code>
  <p>Also, a docker image is provided under
  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/markheckmann/openrepgrid.ic
  with a short instruction how to run the app locally. A screenshot of
  the user interface is displayed in Figure 2. The image shows a grid
  dataset from an interview with <italic>Sylvia</italic> which is also
  contained in the package.</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>Screenshot of the software.</p></caption>
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="media/img/02-screenshot.png" />
  </fig>
  <p>The results of the IC analysis are not displayed interactively but
  are included in an MS Excel file that can be generated and downloaded.
  Also the results of the intermediate IC steps as described in
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14780887.2020.1794088">Burr,
  King, and Heckmann (2020)</ext-link> are contained. The main purpose
  of the software is to automate the cluster identification step of the
  IC procedure, which is a cumbersome and error-prone task if performed
  manually. In Figure 3, an extract of the analysis results for Sylvia’s
  grid and corresponding analysis settings as shown in Figure 2 are
  displayed and subsequently discussed.</p>

<sec id="interpretation">
  <title>Interpretation</title>
  <p>Psychologically relevant information can be obtained from the
  interpretation of the network graphs. What follows is a shortened
  example. More comprehensive examples are outlined in our
  publication.</p>
  <p>In the resulting diagram for Sylvia’s grid in Figure 3, a construct
  is indicated by a circle, with (+) denoting the preferred and (-) the
  non-preferred pole. The diagram shows three clusters (also called
  cliques), indicated by the colored hulls around several constructs. In
  Sylvia’s case, the three clusters are highly overlapping. Two of these
  are of particular interest, sharing a ‘core’ of three constructs –
  ‘(+) Wild, free <italic>vs</italic> (-) controlled, contained’, ‘(+)
  Massive sense of space, expansive <italic>vs</italic> (-) railed-off,
  small world’ and ‘(+) Freedom, wildness <italic>vs</italic> (-)
  conventional’, with (+) indicating the preferred and (-) the
  non-preferred pole. In one cluster, these three constructs are
  strongly associated with ‘(+) Verdant <italic>vs</italic> (-) dead,
  nothing thriving’; the association between her preferred poles
  suggests that she is drawn to places that are thriving and green, wild
  and expansive, as opposed to those which lack life, are small-scale,
  controlled and conventional. However, these three constructs share
  another cluster with the construct ‘(+) Cosy <italic>vs</italic> (-)
  Chaotic’, where ‘cosy’ is her preferred pole. In this cluster,
  however, her desires for the wild, free and expansive appear to be in
  tension with her desire for the ‘cosy’, as they are aligned with her
  non-preferred pole ’chaotic‘. The attraction of wild, free spaces for
  Sylvia is therefore not straightforward.</p>
  <p>The third cluster includes the ‘(+) Verdant <italic>vs</italic> (-)
  dead, nothing thriving’ construct, which is here associated with ‘(+)
  Exciting, a lot going on <italic>vs</italic> (-) flat, unvarying,
  depressed, unenergetic’, ‘(+) Dramatic <italic>vs</italic> (-)
  unvarying, goes on and on’ and ‘(+) Variable <italic>vs</italic> (-)
  doesn’t change’. This suggests that to Sylvia ‘verdant’ spaces are
  also full of excitement, drama and variability- they are full of life
  in these ways. However, the fact that these three constructs do not
  cluster with the wild/expansive/freedom constructs indicates that they
  constitute a somewhat separate idea for her. A ‘wild’ space for her
  need not be ‘exciting’, for example, although a ‘verdant’ space is
  likely to be both exciting and wild. Interpretive clustering therefore
  gives us insight into some of the complexity of Sylvia’s
  construing.</p>
