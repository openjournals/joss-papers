  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Recent advances in intracortical Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
  technology allowed motor disabled patients to partially regain lost
  motor functions
  (<xref alt="Aflalo et al., 2015" rid="ref-RN572" ref-type="bibr">Aflalo
  et al., 2015</xref>;

  et al., 2012</xref>). In these patients, intact neural activity is
  extracted from motor-related areas of the cerebral cortex via
  intracortical implanted electrodes and interpreted by a
  machine-learning algorithm to control a prosthetic device, thereby
  bypassing dysfunctional corticospinal projections that resulted, for
  example, from spinal cord lesions. BCIs of this type have been and
  still are being developed mostly in non-human primate animal models.
  Additionally, they are also used for basic neuroscientific studies in
  animals to establish a specific experimentally-controlled
  transformation between the brain area under investigation and a
  specific behavior
  (<xref alt="Koralek et al., 2012" rid="ref-RN877" ref-type="bibr">Koralek
  et al., 2012</xref>;
  <xref alt="Sadtler et al., 2014" rid="ref-RN219" ref-type="bibr">Sadtler
  et al., 2014</xref>), thereby imposing a direct and controllable
  causal link between brain activity and behavior. The software
  introduced here allows true online BCI control of a computer cursor
  based on physiological signals. Importantly, it also allows realistic
  real-time neural data simulations from artificial spiking neural
  network (SNN). With this, all algorithms and the control architecture
  can be tested in silico identical to the physiological experiment.</p>

<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Software for simulating, testing, and applying BCIs based on
  intracortical recordings of neural spiking activity is not publicly
  available. Most of the publicly available software for BCIs is
  designed for applications based on time-continuous
  electrophysiological signals, like electroencephalographic (EEG) or
  electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals
  (<xref alt="Stegman et al., 2020" rid="ref-RN1263" ref-type="bibr">Stegman
  et al., 2020</xref>). BCImat instead is a Matlab framework for
  implementing and testing a BCI based on stochastic event time-series,
  particularly neuronal spiking signals recorded from large numbers of
  individual neurons that vary at a time-scale of milliseconds.
  Importantly, BCImat can alternatively use as input simulated data from
  a built-in artificial spiking neural network (SNN). This allows
  testing BCI applications with the same algorithm and framework as
  intended for later use in BCI experiments but before the availability
  of recordings from implanted animals or human patients. This way, the
  full online decoding experiment or application can be developed in
  advance without the need for pre-recorded data files. The code is
  intended for use by anyone wanting to test closed-loop BCI methods or
  perform intracortical closed-loop BCI experiments. Here the method was
  tested in rhesus monkeys but it is as well suited for use in other
  species (mice, humans).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="overview">
  <title>Overview</title>
  <p>The software that defines the BCI framework (BCImat, Fig. 1)
  interfaces bi-directionally with the software that serves as a simple
  behavioral task controller (here written in c++, Task Controller Fig.
  1). The task controller allows computer-controlled behavioral
  experiments in which subjects perform center-out reach movements by
  moving a cursor on a screen with the computer mouse. The BCI framework
  interacts with the task controller for the purpose of decoder
  calibration, when first training the machine-learning algorithms to
  link the physical movements of the hand to the corresponding neural
  activity patterns, and then later to control cursor movements
  exclusively based on the neural activity patterns. The communication
  between the task-controller and the BCI framework is done via the
  Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN) protocol, implementing a
  client-server application via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or
  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  (<xref alt="Taylor et al., 2001" rid="ref-RN1260" ref-type="bibr">Taylor
  et al., 2001</xref>) on both sides. On the task controller side, a c++
  server application is used to provide information to BCImat about the
  stages of the behavioral task and the position of the cursor on the
  screen. On the same side, a client application is implemented to
  update the cursor position on the screen that is read from BCImat. On
  the BCImat side, a Matlab executable version of the server and client
  VRPN classes are implemented to read the parameters for calibration
  and send the decoded parameters. Since the communication is
  established via Internet Protocol (IP) network, the task controller
  and the BCI can run on different computers. The BCI framework is
  implemented in object-oriented Matlab to exploit modularity. This
  makes it possible to use more advanced decoders (e.g., non-linear
  long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers) as alternatives
  in order to optimize decoding performance or to provide additional
  functionalities (e.g., to perturb neural parameters for decoding to
  experimentally induce neural plasticity in BCI learning studies).
  Further supporting modularity, BCImat can communicate with other task
  controllers written in any other programming language provided that
  VRPN is used to stream and read information to and from the BCI
  framework. For real intracortical BCI experiments (application mode,
  Fig. 1), the presented package is implemented for interfacing a
  Cereplex system (Blackrock, Salt Lake City, USA), but can easily be
  adapted to other common data acquisition systems. In fact, BCImat can
  be interfaced with any other recording hardware provided that the same
  internal buffer structure to store spiking activity in real-time is
  programed. To use BCImat without recording hardware, an artificial
  spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented (simulation mode, Fig. 1).
  In the simulation mode, we decided to implement the same spike buffer
  structure of the application mode in order to keep compatibility when
  switching among the two modes. The task-controller provided here
  allows performing a center-out reach task with computer mouse
  movements. While the subject performs the task manually, i.e. by
  actually physically moving the arm (manual task), the simulated
  neurons fire accordingly. Mimicking stochastic properties of neural
  activity in the brain, the firing pattern is simulated as a Poisson
  process. The frequency of firing is proportional to the cosine of the
  angle between the direction of movements in the task and their
  preferred direction. Thereby, the SNN simulates neural response
  patterns of primate motor cortex during reaching tasks
  (<xref alt="Georgopoulos et al., 1982" rid="ref-RN1261" ref-type="bibr">Georgopoulos
  et al., 1982</xref>). In practice in the simulation mode, the user
  would first execute the manual task to calibrate the parameters of the
  decoding algorithm. After calibration, one will switch from manual
  task execution to closed-loop “BCI control”. During this closed-loop,
  the cursor movements are controlled via the decoder output and no
  longer by real computer mouse movements. At the same time, the user
  should still perform the task with the mouse, since the cursor
  movement determines the neurons firing pattern of the SNN, which
  serves as input to the decoder. The SNN firing depends on its own
  neural dynamics driven by the cosine model relative to the mouse
  movement direction. Later, in the application mode, the subject’s
  brain activity would replace the SNN output, and physical movements
  would be no longer required to move the cursor. To demonstrate
  functionality and performance, the BCImat code was successfully used
  with neural activity recorded in motor cortical areas of two rhesus
  monkeys performing a center-out reach task in a virtual-reality
  environment, similar to a setup that was previously described
  (<xref alt="Ferrea et al., 2022" rid="ref-ferrea2022statistical" ref-type="bibr">Ferrea
  et al., 2022</xref>). Both animals were housed in social groups with
  one or two male conspecifics in facilities of the German Primate
  Center. The facilities provide cage sizes exceeding the requirements
  by German and European regulations, and access to an enriched
  environment including wooden structures and various toys. All
  procedures have been approved by the responsible regional government
  office [Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und
  Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES)] under permit numbers 3392
  42502-04-13/1100 and comply with German Law and the European Directive
  2010/63/EU regulating use of animals in research. Both animals learned
  to control the cursor via BCImat. The time that the animals needed to
  move the cursor to the targets was in the same order of magnitude
  during manual and BCI task performance in both animals (animal 1:
  median hand movement time = 404 ms, animal 1: median BCImat movement
  time = 585 ms, animal 2: median hand movement time = 418 ms, animal 2:
  median BCImat movement time = 743 ms). Note that the observed decrease
  in performance comparing hand movements with BCI movements is
  generally expected. The implemented decoder is a Kalman-Filter for
  motor control BCI applications
  (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2006" rid="ref-RN1070" ref-type="bibr">Wu et
  al., 2006</xref>). We also implemented some important BCI features
  that are frequently used in the literature. These features were found
  to provide efficient training and better decoding performance. In
  particular, we implemented (i) the possibility to re-train the Kalman
  filter during online control
  (<xref alt="Gilja et al., 2012" rid="ref-RN1" ref-type="bibr">Gilja et
  al., 2012</xref>), (ii) an assisted computer cursor control during
  closed-loop trials
  (<xref alt="Collinger et al., 2013" rid="ref-RN589" ref-type="bibr">Collinger
  et al., 2013</xref>) to perform calibration in absence of movements,
  (iii) rotation of unit preferred directions resulting in movement
  direction rotations
  (<xref alt="Jarosiewicz et al., 2008" rid="ref-RN849" ref-type="bibr">Jarosiewicz
  et al., 2008</xref>), and (iv) the possibility to perform open-loop
  testing of the decoder (for review see Shenoy &amp; Carmena
  (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-RN61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)).</p>

    <caption><p>BCImat framework. The BCImat framework interfaces with a
    task controller to display movements of a cursor on a computer
    screen and with a neural interface providing spiking signal to
    ultimately (after decoder calibration) control cursor movements. The
    neural signal fills an internal spike buffer. The spike buffer is
    fed with input from an artificial spiking neural network (SNN) for
    stand-alone (patient independent) experiments (simulation mode), or
    with external intracortical physiological signals providing neural
    spike data in real-time (application mode). Our system was tested in
    application mode with a Matlab executable (mex) code to stream
    online spikes recorded with a Cereplex system (Blackrock, Salt Lake
    City, USA). Task controller and BCI framework exchange messages,
    cursor position or velocities data via VRPN clients and servers.
    Inside the BCI framework, the cursor velocities are used to
    calibrate the decoder by regressing them with simultaneously
    recorded neural activity. A task state parser is used in BCImat to
    handle received messages from the task controller. It can be
    expanded to handle any type of message. Here, for example,
    information about the completion of a movement is handled to clear
    the spike buffer regularly to avoid memory overload.</p></caption>
