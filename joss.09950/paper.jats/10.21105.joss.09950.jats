  <title>Summary</title>
  <p><monospace>dbparser</monospace> is an rOpenSci peer-reviewed R
  package that provides a unified framework for parsing and integrating
  major pharmacological and pharmacovigilance databases into
  standardized, analysis-ready R objects. The package supports three
  essential drug information resources: DrugBank
  (<xref alt="Wishart et al., 2018" rid="ref-wishart2018drugbank" ref-type="bibr">Wishart
  et al., 2018</xref>), OnSIDES
  (<xref alt="Galeano et al., 2022" rid="ref-galeano2022onsides" ref-type="bibr">Galeano
  et al., 2022</xref>) and TWOSIDES
  (<xref alt="Tatonetti et al., 2012" rid="ref-tatonetti2012data" ref-type="bibr">Tatonetti
  et al., 2012</xref>). Each database is parsed into a consistent nested
  list structure called a <monospace>dvobject</monospace>, which
  preserves complex relational hierarchies while enabling seamless
  cross-database integration. By providing high-performance parsing
  functions, chainable merge operations, and comprehensive metadata
  tracking, <monospace>dbparser</monospace> eliminates a significant
  bottleneck in computational pharmacology research and enables
  reproducible, large-scale drug safety analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>Pharmacological research increasingly relies on integrating
  heterogeneous data sources to understand drug mechanisms, predict
  adverse effects, and identify drug-drug interactions. Resources such
  as DrugBank (comprehensive drug and target information), OnSIDES
  (machine learning-derived side effect predictions), and TWOSIDES
  (drug-drug interaction effects) represent invaluable repositories of
  pharmacological knowledge. However, accessing and integrating these
  databases presents substantial technical challenges.</p>
  <p>Each database employs distinct file formats and structural
  conventions: DrugBank distributes data as deeply nested XML with
  complex entity relationships; OnSIDES provides multiple relational CSV
  files requiring careful joining; TWOSIDES offers compressed flat files
  with different identifier systems. Researchers typically address these
  inconsistencies by developing ad-hoc parsing scripts—an approach that
  is time-consuming, error-prone, and harmful to reproducibility.
  Studies suggest that data preprocessing often consumes 60-80% of total
  analysis time in pharmacoinformatics workflows
  (<xref alt="Wickham, 2014" rid="ref-wickham2014tidy" ref-type="bibr">Wickham,
  2014</xref>).</p>
  <p>The R ecosystem, despite its strength in statistical analysis and
  visualization, lacks dedicated tools for pharmacological database
  integration. While Bioconductor
  (<xref alt="Gentleman et al., 2004" rid="ref-gentleman2004bioconductor" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman
  et al., 2004</xref>) provides excellent infrastructure for genomics
  data, no equivalent standardized framework exists for drug databases.
  <monospace>dbparser</monospace> addresses this gap by providing
  unified parsing functions, chainable integration workflows, rich
  metadata preservation, and high-performance implementations that
  transform weeks of custom development into minutes of reproducible
  analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="state-of-the-field">
  <title>State of the field</title>
  <p>The landscape of tools for accessing pharmacological databases is
  fragmented across languages and lacks comprehensive integration
  capabilities. We surveyed existing solutions before developing
  <monospace>dbparser</monospace> and found significant gaps that
  justified new development rather than contribution to existing
  projects.</p>
  <sec id="r-ecosystem">
    <title>R Ecosystem</title>
    <p>The R pharmacology ecosystem has limited database integration
    tools. The <bold><monospace>drugbankr</monospace> package</bold>
    (archived on CRAN since 2019) provided basic DrugBank XML parsing
    but lacked maintenance, testing infrastructure, and integration
    capabilities. It supported only DrugBank and offered no framework
    for multi-database workflows. <bold>Bioconductor packages</bold>
    such as <monospace>AnnotationHub</monospace> and
    <monospace>biomaRt</monospace> excel at genomic data integration but
    are architecturally designed for gene-centric annotations rather
    than drug-centric pharmacological data. Their data models assume
    different entity relationships (genes → variants → phenotypes) than
    drug databases require (drugs → targets → pathways → diseases →
    adverse events). While technically possible to force pharmacological
    data into these frameworks, doing so creates architectural impedance
    mismatches that complicate downstream analyses.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="python-and-other-languages">
    <title>Python and Other Languages</title>
    <p>Python tools exist for individual databases but lack
    cross-database integration.
    <bold><monospace>pydrugbank</monospace></bold> and
    <bold><monospace>drugbank-downloader</monospace></bold> parse
    DrugBank XML but provide no standardization layer for integrating
    with other resources.
    <bold><monospace>bioservices</monospace></bold> accesses web APIs
    for multiple databases but focuses on real-time queries rather than
    creating integrated, analysis-ready datasets. These tools serve
    different use cases (programmatic access) than
    <monospace>dbparser</monospace> (reproducible local analysis).
    Language barriers also matter: R dominates statistical pharmacology
    and clinical data analysis, making Python-only solutions less
    accessible to the target community.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="commercial-and-manual-approaches">
    <title>Commercial and Manual Approaches</title>
    <p>Commercial platforms like <bold>Clarivate Cortellis</bold> and
    <bold>Certara D360</bold> offer integrated drug data but are
    proprietary, expensive (typically $10,000-$50,000+ annually), and
    provide limited reproducibility for academic research. Researchers
    often resort to manual approaches: writing custom parsing scripts
    for each database, manually reconciling identifiers, and creating
    ad-hoc integration pipelines. These solutions are non-reproducible,
    time-intensive, and lack quality assurance.</p>

    <title>Unique Contribution of dbparser</title>
    <p><monospace>dbparser</monospace> addresses three critical
    gaps:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><bold>(1) Multi-database integration</bold>: No existing R

      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><bold>(2) Production-quality infrastructure</bold>: Achieving
        98% test coverage, rOpenSci peer review, and comprehensive

        ad-hoc scripts or abandoned packages.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><bold>(3) Reproducible research focus</bold>: Unlike

        releases, enabling reproducible analyses that are critical for
        published research. The demonstrated impact—50,000+ downloads,
        10+ peer-reviewed publications, and downstream package
        development—validates that <monospace>dbparser</monospace> fills
        a genuine gap rather than duplicating existing

  <title>Software Design</title>
  <sec id="design-philosophy-and-trade-offs">
    <title>Design Philosophy and Trade-offs</title>
    <p><monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s architecture reflects three
    core design decisions that emerged from extensive experience with
    pharmacological data analysis workflows:</p>
    <p><bold>Unified <monospace>dvobject</monospace> Structure
    vs. Database-Specific Formats:</bold> We chose to transform all
    databases into a consistent nested list structure rather than
    preserving native formats. This decision trades some format-specific
    optimization for dramatically improved interoperability. The
    <monospace>dvobject</monospace> maintains the relational structure
    of each source database while providing consistent access patterns,
    enabling users to apply identical analysis code across different
    data sources. Each <monospace>dvobject</monospace> contains three
    components: (1) tidy data tables compatible with the tidyverse
    ecosystem
    (<xref alt="Wickham et al., 2019" rid="ref-wickham2019welcome" ref-type="bibr">Wickham
    et al., 2019</xref>), (2) comprehensive metadata (version, parse
    timestamp, schema information), and (3) relationship mappings
    documenting cross-table linkages.</p>
    <p><bold>Hub-and-Spoke Integration Model:</bold> Rather than
    attempting all-to-all database linking, we implemented DrugBank as
    the central integration hub. This reflects DrugBank’s comprehensive
    identifier mappings (RxCUI, PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG) and its
    established role as a reference resource. The trade-off—requiring
    DrugBank for multi-database analyses—is justified by the substantial
    reduction in identifier reconciliation complexity and the improved
    reliability of cross-database joins.</p>
    <p><bold>Chainable Merge Operations:</bold> Integration functions
    are designed for pipeline composition using the magrittr pipe
    operator, enabling workflows like
    <monospace>drugbank_db %&gt;% merge_drugbank_onsides(onsides_db) %&gt;% merge_drugbank_twosides(twosides_db)</monospace>.
    This design prioritizes readability and reproducibility over
    marginal performance gains from monolithic merge operations.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="architectural-foundation">
    <title>Architectural Foundation</title>
    <p>As detailed in the State of the Field section, existing tools
    focus on single databases or different domains (genomics
    vs. pharmacology). <monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s architecture
    was specifically designed for multi-database pharmacological
    integration, building on lessons learned from evaluating
    alternatives. The <monospace>dvobject</monospace> structure emerged
    from the need to preserve complex relational hierarchies (drug →
    target → pathway → disease) while providing consistent access
    patterns across heterogeneous sources. This design enables the
    downstream package ecosystem (dbdataset, covid19dbcand) and
    published research applications that would be technically
    prohibitive with existing tools.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="validation-through-ecosystem-development">
    <title>Validation Through Ecosystem Development</title>
    <p>The extensibility of <monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s
    architecture has been validated through the development of two
    downstream packages that build upon its infrastructure:</p>
    <p><bold>dbdataset</bold>
    (<xref alt="Ali, 2024" rid="ref-dbdataset" ref-type="bibr">Ali,
    2024</xref>): Provides pre-parsed DrugBank datasets in ready-to-use
    R dataframe format, eliminating the need for users to download and
    parse large XML files. This package leverages
    <monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s parsing functions to create
    versioned, reproducible datasets for machine learning and
    exploratory analysis.</p>
    <p><bold>covid19dbcand</bold>
    (<xref alt="Ali, 2022" rid="ref-covid19dbcand" ref-type="bibr">Ali,
    2022</xref>): Delivers curated COVID-19 drug candidate datasets
    extracted from DrugBank during the pandemic response. This package
    demonstrated <monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s value for rapid
    response research, enabling researchers to quickly access potential
    therapeutic candidates without time-consuming data extraction.</p>
    <p>These downstream packages demonstrate that
    <monospace>dbparser</monospace>’s <monospace>dvobject</monospace>
    structure and parsing functions provide a stable foundation for
    building domain-specific data products—a key indicator of successful
    research software design.</p>
