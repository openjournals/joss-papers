  <title>Summary and statement of need</title>
  <p>The ever-increasing demand for resolution and accuracy in
  mathematical models of physical processes governed by systems of
  Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) can only be addressed using
  fully-parallel advanced numerical discretization methods and scalable
  solution methods, thus able to exploit the vast amount of
  computational resources in state-of-the-art supercomputers. To this
  end, GridapDistributed is a registered Julia
  (<xref alt="Bezanson et al., 2017" rid="ref-Bezanson2017" ref-type="bibr">Bezanson
  et al., 2017</xref>) software package which provides fully-parallel
  distributed memory data structures and associated methods for the
  Finite Element (FE) numerical solution of PDEs on parallel computers.
  Thus, it can be run on multi-core CPU desktop computers at small
  scales, as well as on HPC clusters and supercomputers at medium/large
  scales. The data structures in GridapDistributed are designed to
  mirror as far as possible their counterparts in the Gridap
  (<xref alt="Badia &amp; Verdugo, 2020" rid="ref-Badia2020" ref-type="bibr">Badia
  &amp; Verdugo, 2020</xref>) Julia software package, while
  implementing/leveraging most of their abstract interfaces (see
  Francesc Verdugo &amp; Badia
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-VerdugoU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
  for a detailed overview of the software design of Gridap). As a
  result, sequential Julia scripts written in the high-level Application
  Programming Interface (API) of Gridap can be used verbatim up to minor
  adjustments in a parallel distributed memory context using
  GridapDistributed. This equips end-users with a tool for the
  development of simulation codes able to solve real-world application
  problems on massively parallel supercomputers while using a highly
  expressive, compact syntax that resembles mathematical notation. This
  is indeed one of the main advantages of GridapDistributed and a major
  design goal that we pursue.</p>
  <p>In order to scale FE simulations to large core counts, the mesh
  used to discretize the computational domain on which the PDE is posed
  must be partitioned (distributed) among the parallel tasks such that
  each of these only holds a local portion of the global mesh. The same
  requirement applies to the rest of data structures in the FE
  simulation pipeline, i.e., FE space, linear system, solvers, data
  output, etc. The local portion of each task is composed by a set of
  cells that it owns, i.e., the <italic>local cells</italic> of the
  task, and a set of off-processor cells (owned by remote processors)
  which are in touch with its local cells, i.e., the <italic>ghost
  cells</italic> of the task
  (<xref alt="Badia et al., 2020" rid="ref-Badia2020a" ref-type="bibr">Badia
  et al., 2020</xref>). This overlapped mesh partition is used by
  GridapDistributed, among others, to exchange data among nearest
  neighbors, and to glue together global Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) which
  are sitting on the interface among subdomains. Following this design
  principle, GridapDistributed provides scalable parallel data
  structures and associated methods for simple grid handling (in
  particular, Cartesian-like meshes of arbitrary-dimensional,
  topologically n-cube domains), FE spaces setup, and distributed linear
  system assembly. It is in our future plans to provide highly scalable
  linear and nonlinear solvers tailored for the FE discretization of
  PDEs (e.g., linear and nonlinear matrix-free geometric multigrid and
  domain decomposition preconditioners). In the meantime, however,
  GridapDistributed can be combined with other Julia packages in order
  to realize the full potential required in real-world applications.
  These packages and their relation with GridapDistributed are
  overviewed in the next section.</p>
  <p>There are a number of high quality open source parallel finite
  element packages available in the literature. Some examples are
  deal.II
  (<xref alt="Arndt et al., 2021" rid="ref-dealII93" ref-type="bibr">Arndt
  et al., 2021</xref>), libMesh
  (<xref alt="Kirk et al., 2006" rid="ref-libMeshPaper" ref-type="bibr">Kirk
  et al., 2006</xref>), MFEM
  (<xref alt="Anderson et al., 2021" rid="ref-mfem" ref-type="bibr">Anderson
  et al., 2021</xref>), FEMPAR
  (<xref alt="Badia et al., 2017" rid="ref-Badia2017" ref-type="bibr">Badia
  et al., 2017</xref>), FEniCS
  (<xref alt="Logg et al., 2012" rid="ref-fenics-book" ref-type="bibr">Logg
  et al., 2012</xref>), or FreeFEM++
  (<xref alt="Hecht, 2012" rid="ref-freefem" ref-type="bibr">Hecht,
  2012</xref>), to name a few. All these packages have their own set of
  features, potentials, and limitations. Among these, FEniCS and
  FreeFEM++ are perhaps the closest ones in scope and spirit to the
  packages in the Gridap ecosystem. A hallmark of Gridap ecosystem
  packages compared to FreeFEM++ and FEniCS is that a very expressive
  and compact (yet efficient) syntax is transformed into low-level code
  using the Julia JIT compiler and thus they do not need a sophisticated
  compiler of variational forms nor a more intricate workflow (e.g., a
  Python front-end and a C/C++ back-end).</p>

<sec id="building-blocks-and-composability">
  <title>Building blocks and composability</title>
  <p><xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Apackages">Figure 1</xref> depicts
  the relation among GridapDistributed and other packages in the Julia
  package ecosystem. The interaction of GridapDistributed and its
  dependencies is mainly designed with separation of concerns in mind
  towards high composability and modularity. On the one hand, Gridap
  provides a rich set of abstract types/interfaces suitable for the FE
  solution of PDEs (see Francesc Verdugo &amp; Badia
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-VerdugoU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
  for more details). It also provides realizations (implementations) of
  these abstractions tailored to serial/multi-threaded computing
  environments. GridapDistributed <bold>implements</bold> these
  abstractions for parallel distributed-memory computing environments.
  To this end, GridapDistributed also leverages (<bold>uses</bold>) the
  serial realizations in Gridap and associated methods to handle the
  local portion on each parallel task. (See
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Apackages">Figure 1</xref> arrow
  labels.) On the other hand, GridapDistributed relies on
  PartitionedArrays
  (<xref alt="F. Verdugo, 2021" rid="ref-parrays" ref-type="bibr">F.
  Verdugo, 2021</xref>) in order to handle the parallel execution model
  (e.g., message-passing via the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
  (<xref alt="Message Passing Interface Forum, 2021" rid="ref-mpi40" ref-type="bibr">Message
  Passing Interface Forum, 2021</xref>)), global data distribution
  layout, and communication among tasks. PartitionedArrays also provides
  a parallel implementation of partitioned global linear systems (i.e.,
  linear algebra vectors and sparse matrices) as needed in grid-based
  numerical simulations. While PartitionedArrays is an stand-alone
  package, segregated from GridapDistributed, it was designed with
  parallel FE packages such as GridapDistributed in mind. In any case,
  GridapDistributed is designed so that a different distributed linear
  algebra library from PartitionedArrays might be used as well, as far
  as it is able to provide the same functionality.</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>GridapDistributed and its relation to other packages in
    the Julia package ecosystem. In this diagram, each rectangle
    represents a Julia package, while the (directed) arrows represent
    relations (dependencies) among packages. Both the direction of the
    arrow and the label attached to the arrows are used to denote the
    nature of the relation. Thus, e.g., GridapDistributed depends on
    Gridap and PartitionedArrays, and GridapPETSc depends on Gridap and
    PartitionedArrays. Note that, in the diagram, the arrow direction is
    relevant, e.g., GridapP4est depends on GridapDistributed but not
    conversely.

  <p>As mentioned earlier, GridapDistributed offers a built-in
  Cartesian-like mesh generator, and does not provide, by now, built-in
  highly scalable solvers. To address this, as required by real-world
  applications, one can combine GridapDistributed with GridapP4est
  (<xref alt="Martin, 2021" rid="ref-gridap4est" ref-type="bibr">Martin,
  2021</xref>) and GridapPETSc
  (<xref alt="F. Verdugo et al., 2021" rid="ref-gridapetsc" ref-type="bibr">F.
  Verdugo et al., 2021</xref>) (see
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Apackages">Figure 1</xref>). The
  former provides a mesh data structure that leverages the p4est library
  as highly scalable mesh generation engine
  (<xref alt="Burstedde et al., 2011" rid="ref-Burstedde2011" ref-type="bibr">Burstedde
  et al., 2011</xref>). This engine can mesh domains that can be
  expressed as a forest of adaptive octrees. The latter enables the
  usage of the highly scalable solvers (e.g., algebraic multigrid) in
  the PETSc library

<sec id="usage-example">
  <title>Usage example</title>
  <p>In order to confirm our previous claims on expressiveness,
  conciseness and productivity (e.g., a very small number of lines of
  code), the example Julia script below illustrates how one may use
  GridapDistributed in order to solve, in parallel, a 2D Poisson problem
  defined on the unit square. (In order to fully understand the code
  snippet, familiarity with the high level API of Gridap is assumed.)
  The domain is discretized using the parallel Cartesian-like mesh
  generator built-in in GridapDistributed. The only minimal burden posed
  on the programmer versus Gridap is a call to the
  <monospace>prun</monospace> function of PartitionedArrays right at the
  beginning of the program. With this function, the programmer sets up
  the PartitionedArrays communication backend (i.e., MPI communication
  backend in the example), specifies the number of parts and their
  layout (i.e., <monospace>(2,2)</monospace> 2D layout in the example),
  and provides a function (using Julia do-block syntax for function
  arguments in the example) to be run on each part. This function is
  equivalent to a sequential Gridap script, except for the
  <monospace>CartesianDiscreteModel</monospace> call, which, in
  GridapDistributed, also requires the <monospace>parts</monospace>
  argument passed back by the <monospace>prun</monospace> function. In a
  typical cluster environment, this example would be executed on 4 MPI
  tasks from a terminal as
  <monospace>mpirun -n 4 julia --project=. example.jl</monospace>.</p>

  The domain was discretized using the built-in Cartesian-like mesh
  generator in GridapDistributed. The code was run on the NCI@Gadi
  Australian supercomputer (3024 nodes, 2x 24-core Intel Xeon Scalable
  <italic>Cascade Lake</italic> cores and 192 GB of RAM per node) with
  Julia 1.7 and OpenMPI 4.1.2. For the strong scaling test, we used a
  fixed <bold>global</bold> problem size resulting from the trilinear FE
  discretization of the domain using a 300x300x300 hexaedra mesh (26.7
  MDoFs) and we scaled the number of cores up to 21.9K cores. For the
  weak scaling test, we used a fixed <bold>local</bold> problem size of
  32x32x32 hexaedra, and we scaled the number of cores up to 16.5K
  cores. A global problem size of 0.54 billion DoFs was solved for this
  number of cores. The reported wall clock time includes: (1) Mesh
  generation; (2) Generation of global FE space; (3) Assembly of
  distributed linear system; (4) Interpolation of a manufactured
  solution; (5) Computation of the residual (includes a matrix-vector
  product) and its norm. Note that the linear solver time (GAMG built-in
  solver in PETSc) was not included in the total computation time as it
  is actually external to GridapDistributed.</p>

<sec id="demo-application">
  <title>Demo application</title>
  <p>To highlight the ability of GridapDistributed and associated
  packages (see
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Apackages">Figure 1</xref>) to tackle
  real-world problems, and the potential behind its composable
  architecture, we consider a demo application with interest in the
  geophysical fluid dynamics community. This application solves the
  so-called non-linear rotating shallow water equations on the sphere,
  i.e., a surface PDE posed on a two-dimensional manifold immersed in
  three-dimensional space. This complex system of PDEs describes the
  dynamics of a single incompressible thin layer of constant density
  fluid with a free surface under rotational effects. It is often used
  as a test bed for horizontal discretisations with application to
  numerical weather prediction and ocean modelling. We in particular
  considered the synthetic benchmark proposed in
  (<xref alt="Galewsky et al., 2016" rid="ref-Galewsky2016" ref-type="bibr">Galewsky
  et al., 2016</xref>), which is characterized by its ability to
  generate a complex and realistic flow.</p>
  <p>For the geometrical discretization of the sphere, the software uses
  the so-called cubed sphere mesh
  (<xref alt="Ronchi et al., 1996" rid="ref-Ronchi1996" ref-type="bibr">Ronchi
  et al., 1996</xref>), which was implemented using GridapP4est. The
  spatial discretization of the equations relies on GridapDistributed to
  build a <bold>compatible</bold> set of FE spaces
  (<xref alt="Gibson et al., 2019" rid="ref-Gibson2019" ref-type="bibr">Gibson
  et al., 2019</xref>) for the system unknowns (fluid velocity, fluid
  depth, potential vorticity and mass flux) grounded on Raviart-Thomas
  and Lagrangian FEs defined on the manifold
  (<xref alt="Rognes et al., 2013" rid="ref-Rognes2013" ref-type="bibr">Rognes
  et al., 2013</xref>). Compatible FEs are advanced discretization
  techniques that preserve at the discrete level physical properties of
  the continuous equations. In order to stabilize the spatial
  discretization we use the most standard stabilization method in the
  geophysical flows literature, namely the so-called Anticipated
  Potential Vorticity Method (APVM)
  (<xref alt="Rognes et al., 2013" rid="ref-Rognes2013" ref-type="bibr">Rognes
  et al., 2013</xref>). We stress that other stabilisation techniques,
  e.g., Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG)-like methods, have also
  been implemented with these tools
  (<xref alt="Lee et al., 2022" rid="ref-Lee2022" ref-type="bibr">Lee et
  al., 2022</xref>). Time integration is based on a fully-implicit
  trapezoidal rule, and thus a fully-coupled nonlinear problem has to be
  solved at each time step. In order to solve this nonlinear problem, we
  leveraged a Newton-GMRES solver preconditioned with an algebraic
  preconditioner provided by GridapPETSc (on top of PETSc 3.16). The
  <italic>exact</italic> Jacobian of the shallow water system was
  computed/assembled at each nonlinear iteration.</p>
  <p><xref alt="Figure 3" rid="figU003Agalewsky_scaling">Figure 3</xref>
  shows the magnitude of the vorticity field after 6.5 simulation days
  (left) and the results of a strong scaling study of the model on the
  Australian Gadi@NCI supercomputer (right). The spurious ringing
  artifacts in the magnitude of the vorticity field are well-known in
  the APVM method at coarse resolutions and can be corrected using a
  more effective stabilization method, such as, e.g., SUPG-like
  stabilization
  (<xref alt="Lee et al., 2022" rid="ref-Lee2022" ref-type="bibr">Lee et
  al., 2022</xref>). The reported times correspond to the
  <italic>total</italic> wall time of the first 10 time integration
  steps; these were the only ones (out of 3600 time steps, i.e., 20
  simulation days with a time step size of 480 secs.) that we could
  afford running for all points in the plot due to limited computational
  budget reasons. We considered two different problem sizes,
  corresponding to 256x256 and 512x512 quadrilaterals/panel cubed sphere
  meshes, resp. We stress that the time discretization is fully
  implicit. Thus we can afford larger time step sizes than with explicit
  methods. Besides, the purpose of the experiment is to evaluate the
  scalability of the framework, and not necessarily to obtain physically
  meaningful simulation results. Overall,
  <xref alt="Figure 3" rid="figU003Agalewsky_scaling">Figure 3</xref>
  confirms a remarkable ability of the ecosystem of Julia packages at
  hand to efficiently reduce computation times with increasing number of
  CPU cores for a complex, real-world computational model.</p>
