  <title>Summary</title>
  <p><monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> is a python package for
  simulating the transport and dispersion of plastics in the ocean. The
  tool is based on <monospace>v3.0.3</monospace> of the
  <monospace>parcels</monospace> computational Lagrangian ocean analysis
  framework
  (<xref alt="Delandmeter &amp; van Sebille, 2019" rid="ref-Delandmeter2019" ref-type="bibr">Delandmeter
  &amp; van Sebille, 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Lange &amp; van Sebille, 2017" rid="ref-Lange2017" ref-type="bibr">Lange
  &amp; van Sebille, 2017</xref>), providing a modular and customisable
  collection of methods, notebooks, and tutorials for advecting virtual
  plastic particles with a wide range of physical properties. The tool
  applies a collection of physical processes to the virtual particles,
  such as Stokes drift, wind-induced drift, biofouling, and turbulent
  mixing, via custom particle behaviour programmed in the form of
  <monospace>Kernels</monospace>. In addition to the fine-scale physics
  parameterisations, <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> provides
  global particle initialisation maps that represent best estimates for
  plastic pollution emissions along coastlines
  (<xref alt="Jambeck et al., 2015" rid="ref-Jambeck2015" ref-type="bibr">Jambeck
  et al., 2015</xref>), from river sources
  (<xref alt="Meijer et al., 2021" rid="ref-Meijer2021" ref-type="bibr">Meijer
  et al., 2021</xref>), and in the open-ocean from fishing-related
  activities
  (<xref alt="Kroodsma et al., 2018" rid="ref-Kroodsma2018" ref-type="bibr">Kroodsma
  et al., 2018</xref>), as well as a current best estimate of buoyant
  plastic concentrations globally
  (<xref alt="Kaandorp et al., 2023" rid="ref-Kaandorp2023" ref-type="bibr">Kaandorp
  et al., 2023</xref>). We envisage
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> as a tool for easy-to-run
  plastic dispersal simulations; as well as for rapid prototyping,
  development, and testing of new fine-scale physics
  parameterisations.</p>
  <p>The current version supports nano- and microplastic behaviour, with
  support for macroplastics planned in the near-future. It has been
  designed for use with hydrodynamic and biogeochemical data from the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://marine.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus
  Marine Service</ext-link>, providing new plastic modelling
  capabilities as part of the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neccton.eu/">NECCTON
  (New Copernicus Capability for Trophic Ocean Networks)</ext-link>
  project. <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> is easily adapted to
  run on local machines and high-performance computing (HPC)
  architecture with various hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, and other
  model fields as input. A future goal is to embed
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> within a cloud platform to allow
  for even more rapid prototyping, development, and simulations.</p>
  <p>The core features of <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> are: 1)
  a user-friendly python notebook layer on top of
  <monospace>parcels</monospace> that provides a streamlined workflow
  for performing plastic dispersal simulations, 2) custom
  <monospace>parcels</monospace> kernels designed to simulate the
  fine-scale physical processes that influence the transport of nano-
  and microplastic particulates, and 3) global particle initialisation
  maps which represent the best estimate locations of plastic pollution
  emissions from coastal sources, river sources, open ocean
  fishing-related activity emission sources, and a current best estimate
  of buoyant plastic concentrations. We visualise these initialisation
  maps in Fig.

  <p>In addition, due to the flexibility of the package, users may use
  the functions and modular design of
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> to enhance their existing
  <monospace>parcels</monospace> simulations and workflow. For example,
  users can use the initialisation maps, associated
  <monospace>ParticleSet</monospace> creation methods, and/or the custom
  physics kernels with their own <monospace>parcels</monospace>
  simulations. Post-processing and analysis of the generated trajectory
  datasets is purposefully left to the user, however some tutorials are
  provided in the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plastic.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/examples.html"><monospace>plasticparcels</monospace>
  documentation</ext-link>, along with the tutorials in the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/documentation.html"><monospace>parcels</monospace>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Marine plastic debris can be found almost everywhere in the ocean.
  A recent study estimates that there is approximately 3,200 kilotonnes
  of (initially) positively buoyant plastics in the global ocean in the
  year 2020
  (<xref alt="Kaandorp et al., 2023" rid="ref-Kaandorp2023" ref-type="bibr">Kaandorp
  et al., 2023</xref>), where 59-62% of these plastics are found at the
  ocean surface, 36-39% within the deeper ocean, and 1.5-1.9% along the
  coastline. They estimate that 500 kilotonnes of positively buoyant
  plastic enters the ocean each year, where 39-42% originate from
  mismanaged waste along coastlines, 45-48% originate from
  fishing-related activities (e.g. fishing lines, nets, traps, and
  crates), and 12-13% from mismanaged waste entering the ocean via
  rivers.</p>
  <p>Due to its durable, inert, and cheap-to-manufacture nature, plastic
  has become one of the most abundant manufactured synthetic materials
  on Earth. Between 1950 and 2017 an estimated 8,300 million tonnes
  (<xref alt="Geyer et al., 2017" rid="ref-Geyer2017" ref-type="bibr">Geyer
  et al., 2017</xref>) of virgin plastic was produced, with the rate of
  production only set to increase. Its durability is of primary concern
  to the marine environment, where, without intervention, they will
  likely degrade and fragment into smaller pieces that will disperse
  across ever larger distances. These plastics interact and interfere
  with marine wildlife, either entangling, or being inadvertently
  ingested, with documented cases affecting over 900 marine species so
  far
  (<xref alt="Kühn &amp; Franeker, 2020" rid="ref-Kuhn2020" ref-type="bibr">Kühn
  &amp; Franeker, 2020</xref>). To better understand and predict the
  effects of plastic pollution on the marine environment, it is of
  paramount importance to map where and how plastic enters our ocean,
  and the pathways of transport, dispersal patterns, and ultimate fate
  of these plastics.</p>
  <p>Lagrangian ocean analysis, where virtual particles are tracked in
  hydrodynamic flow fields, is widely used to uncover and investigate
  the pathways and timescales of the dispersion of plastic particulates
  in the ocean

  <xref alt="Lebreton et al., 2012" rid="ref-Lebreton2012" ref-type="bibr">Lebreton
  et al., 2012</xref>). However, two important questions arise when
  performing such Lagrangian simulations. Firstly, what physical
  processes drive the transport and dispersal of a plastic particle? The
  properties of plastic particles (e.g., size, shape, and density)
  determine what the dominant physical processes are at play, and due to
  the chaotic nature of the ocean, the dispersal patterns and transport
  behaviours of plastics will critically depend on their properties.
  Current state-of-the-art ocean models are either too coarse in
  resolution to capture these processes, or disregard these processes
  entirely, and so parameterising these processes is important to model
  and simulate their effects. Secondly, what are the initial release
  locations and concentrations of marine plastic pollution? Forecasting
  near-future spatial maps of plastic concentrations is largely an
  initial value problem, relying on accurate initial conditions for a
  realistic simulation output. As yet, there is no single comprehensive
  dataset of estimates for current marine plastic pollution
  concentrations, mismanaged plastic waste along coastlines, mismanaged
  plastic waste in rivers, and plastic entering the ocean from
  fishing-related activities. Combining best estimates of current marine
  plastic pollution concentrations with likely future plastic pollution
  sources is necessary for predicting near-future plastic concentration
  maps in the ocean.</p>
  <p>The past decade has seen a growing number of community-developed
  software packages for performing Lagrangian simulations

  <xref alt="Paris et al., 2013" rid="ref-Paris2013" ref-type="bibr">Paris
  et al., 2013</xref>). In many cases, these packages are specific to
  particular particle classes or hydrodynamic models, or are written and
  embedded in proprietary software languages, and can be inflexible or
  difficult to integrate into different applications. In the case of
  plastic dispersal simulations, the underlying physical processes are
  still being researched and their implementation is under development
  (<xref alt="van Sebille et al., 2020" rid="ref-vanSebille2020" ref-type="bibr">van
  Sebille et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, an open-source, flexible, and
  modular approach to performing Lagrangian simulations is necessary for
  prototyping, developing, and testing new physical process
  parameterisation schemes. Easy-to-run simulations allow for a more
  reproducable results, and for simple-to-produce sensitivity
  analyses.</p>
  <p>Here, we have developed <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> as an
  extension of the <monospace>parcels</monospace> Lagrangian framework
  (<xref alt="Delandmeter &amp; van Sebille, 2019" rid="ref-Delandmeter2019" ref-type="bibr">Delandmeter
  &amp; van Sebille, 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Lange &amp; van Sebille, 2017" rid="ref-Lange2017" ref-type="bibr">Lange
  &amp; van Sebille, 2017</xref>) in order to unify plastic dispersion
  modelling into one easy-to-use code. While
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> has been designed for
  researchers who routinely perform plastic particle dispersion
  simulations, it is equally useful to novice users who are new to
  Lagrangian ocean analysis techniques. The core functionality of
  <monospace>parcels</monospace> are its
  <monospace>FieldSet</monospace>, <monospace>ParticleSet</monospace>,
  and <monospace>Kernel</monospace> objects. In the context of
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace>, the
  <monospace>FieldSet</monospace> contains a collection of hydrodynamic,
  physical, and biogeochemical fields required for plastic particle
  advection. The <monospace>ParticleSet</monospace> contains a set of
  plastic particles with their time-evolving properties, such as their
  position, accumulated biofilm amount, and density. A
  <monospace>Kernel</monospace> defines the specific computational
  behaviour for simulating a physical process applied to a plastic
  particle.</p>
  <p>In <monospace>parcels</monospace>, these
  <monospace>Kernel</monospace> objects are designed to be as flexible
  and customisable as possible so that users can perform Lagrangian
  simulations of a wide variety of particulates, such as tuna, plastic,
  plankton, icebergs, turtles
  (<xref alt="Lange &amp; van Sebille, 2017" rid="ref-Lange2017" ref-type="bibr">Lange
  &amp; van Sebille, 2017</xref>). However, due to the flexible nature
  of the software in general, there is a steep learning curve for new
  users, who often find it difficult to setup their simulations in a
  rapid fashion due to the complexity of modern hydrodynamic model
  output. We have developed <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> as
  user-friendly tool specifically designed for easy-to-generate plastic
  dispersal simulations. While <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> is
  primarily designed for use in the cloud and in HPC environments (due
  to the typically terabyte-size of hydrodynamic datasets generated from
  ocean general circulation models), it can be easily installed and run
  on local machines. A schematic of
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> is shown in Fig.

  <p>Here, we briefly demonstrate how
  <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace> can be used for a microplastic
  dispersal simulation in the Mediterranean Sea. The tutorial can be

  waste dataset
  (<xref alt="Jambeck et al., 2015" rid="ref-Jambeck2015" ref-type="bibr">Jambeck

  (surface-bound) microplastic particles subject to the effects of
  Stokes drift and wind-induced drift, neglecting any vertical motion
  (along with any biofouling, or vertical mixing).</p>
  <p>We start by importing <monospace>plasticparcels</monospace>,
  loading pre-defined settings that include information about the models
  and parameter settings for our simulation, and defining the start

  <p>After turning on/off certain behaviour kernels, we define our

    'plastic_diameter' : 0.001, # Plastic particle diameter (m)
    'plastic_density' : 1030.,  # Plastic particle density (kg/m^3)
}

settings['release'] = {
    'initialisation_type': 'coastal',
    'country': 'Italy',
