  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>BioDeg is an open-source software written in FreeFEM (a
  domain-specific language for finite element programming), C++, and
  Python for modeling the degradation of metallic biomaterials and
  simulating the biodegradation behavior of medical devices and implants
  in corrosion experiments. The underlying mathematical and
  computational models are already validated in the previous
  contributions
  (<xref alt="Barzegari et al., 2021" rid="ref-barzegari2021" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari

  <xref alt="Barzegari &amp; Geris, 2022b" rid="ref-barzegari2022" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
  &amp; Geris, 2022b</xref>) by comparing the predictions made by the
  code with the experimentally obtained quantities. BioDeg supports
  simulating the change of morphology of the biodegradable part, release
  of materials, formation of surface corrosion products, the effect of
  the surrounding environment (such as various electrolyte solutions and
  chemical components as well as the presence of fluid flow), and change
  of other quantities (such as pH). It features command-line and
  graphical interfaces, being available on all major operating systems
  and platforms. BioDeg is designed with open standards in mind and as a
  result, can be easily integrated into other established workflows such
  as topology optimization and tissue growth models.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Biomaterials, the substances we put inside the body to
  replace/repair a lost functionality, can be classified into two
  categories from a biodegradation perspective: bio-inert and
  biodegradable. While the former type has a few interactions with its
  surrounding environment, the latter gradually disappears and gets
  absorbed by the body
  (<xref alt="Chen et al., 2014" rid="ref-Chen2014" ref-type="bibr">Chen
  et al., 2014</xref>;
  <xref alt="Zheng et al., 2014" rid="ref-Zheng2014" ref-type="bibr">Zheng
  et al., 2014</xref>). Although bio-inert biomaterials show a great
  performance especially in fixation applications, they bring an
  important problem into play: they remain in the body forever or
  require additional surgery to remove them. Biodegradable materials do
  not have this problem, and in the case of metallic biomaterials, they
  also provide a suitable mechanical stability profile. However, taking
  advantage of them requires tuning the degradation parameters and
  material release rate
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2017" rid="ref-Zhao2017" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
  <p>This problem is usually investigated by conducting
  <italic>in-vitro</italic> (in the lab) and <italic>in-vivo</italic>
  (in a living system) tests of biodegradable metallic implants, which
  requires conducting multiple experiments for different scenarios and
  situations and spending a lot of resources. Developing a quantitative
  mathematical model of the degradation process is a proper solution to
  this issue by allowing researchers to study the biodegradation
  behavior of any desired implant <italic>in-silico</italic> (in the
  computer) prior to conducting any <italic>in-vitro</italic> or
  <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments. Developed mathematical models
  can be simulated using efficient numerical methods such as the finite
  element method.</p>
  <p>Although there is a wide variety of relevant theoretical studies in
  the field of corrosion and biodegradation simulation

  <xref alt="Wilder et al., 2014" rid="ref-Wilder2014" ref-type="bibr">Wilder
  et al., 2014</xref>), to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of
  the developed models has been publicly released together with their
  code to be evaluated by the scientific community. It means that none
  of the previous contributions are available as a software tool for
  relevant users such as researchers in biomaterials science,
  regenerative medicine (tissue engineering), and biomedical
  engineering.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the available tools used to implement aforementioned
  models are not open-source or have the issue of restricted access. For
  example, COMSOL multiphysics (COMSOL Inc., USA) has a module for
  mechanistic corrosion simulation, although it lacks certain
  research-related features like simulating the change of morphology of
  the corroding object and freedom in defining the chemical reactions.
  Another example in this regard is the MuPhyS software
  (<xref alt="Dolgikh et al., 2019" rid="ref-Dolgikh2019" ref-type="bibr">Dolgikh
  et al., 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Köhn et al., 2021" rid="ref-Christoph2021" ref-type="bibr">Köhn
  et al., 2021</xref>) developed by the research group of
  Electrochemical and Surface Engineering (SURF), Vrije Universiteit
  Brussel, Brussels, Belgium. Despite being able to perform mechanistic
  biodegradation simulations, MuPhys is a closed-source software for
  in-house applications and is not publicly available to general
  users.</p>
  <p>BioDeg is a fully open-source biodegradation and corrosion
  simulation software, currently validated for magnesium biomaterials
  (<xref alt="Barzegari et al., 2021" rid="ref-barzegari2021" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
  et al., 2021</xref>). A cross-platform and easy-to-use user interface
  makes it possible for anyone to use the program to simulate the
  biodegradation behavior of metallic implants with any shape of
  interest without concerning the technical aspects of the code.
  Technically speaking, BioDeg uses the finite element method to solve a
  set of partial differential equations derived mechanistically from the
  chemistry of biodegradation and utilizes high-performance computing
  (HPC) techniques to make the computation scalable to hundreds and
  thousands of computational nodes.</p>

    <title>Basic concepts</title>
    <p>From a general point of view, material modeling techniques are
    categorized as either stochastic or deterministic. In stochastic
    modeling, material state evolution is modeled by a set of
    semi-random rules, implying the conditions in which materials
    interact with their surrounding environment. On the other hand,
    deterministic modeling takes advantage of conservative laws in
    physics, formulating the interactions of materials by means of the
    rules such as the ones coming from transport phenomena
    (<xref alt="Kurtz, 1972" rid="ref-Kurtz1972" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz,
    1972</xref>).</p>
    <p>BioDeg works based on the principles of deterministic modeling
    for predicting the biodegradation and corrosion of metallic
    materials. Several studies have demonstrated that this type of
    modeling has a high potential in representing the biodegradation and
    corrosion phenomena
    (<xref alt="Bajger et al., 2016" rid="ref-Bajger2016" ref-type="bibr">Bajger
    et al., 2016</xref>;
    <xref alt="Dolgikh et al., 2019" rid="ref-Dolgikh2019" ref-type="bibr">Dolgikh
    et al., 2019</xref>;
    <xref alt="Sanz-Herrera et al., 2018" rid="ref-SanzHerrera2018" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Herrera
    et al., 2018</xref>). BioDeg is built upon a mechanistic formulation
    of the biodegradation process
    (<xref alt="Barzegari et al., 2021" rid="ref-barzegari2021" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    et al., 2021</xref>). The developed model captures the release of
    metallic ions, changes in pH, the formation of a protective film,
    the dissolution of this film in presence of different ions, and the
    effect of fluid flow of the surrounding solution. This has been
    accomplished by deriving a system of time-dependent
    reaction-diffusion-convection partial differential equations (PDEs)
    from the underlying oxidation-reduction reactions. The level set
    formalism
    (<xref alt="Ronald Fedkiw, 2002" rid="ref-RonaldFedkiw2002" ref-type="bibr">Ronald
    Fedkiw, 2002</xref>) was employed to track the biodegradation
    interface between the biomaterial and its surroundings, enabling the
    model to monitor the morphological changes of the investigated
    implant/device during the biodegradation process. As an example of
    BioDeg output, figure <xref alt="1" rid="screw">1</xref>
    demonstrates the simulation results of the biodegradation of an
    orthopedics screw, in which the white body and the color contour
    show the degrading shape of the screw and concentration of metallic
    ions as they are released over time, respectively. The current model
    is able to simulate diffusion-based corrosion only, and localized
    corrosion is not supported yet, but further development is being
    done to make the model capable of simulating non-uniform corrosion
    as well.</p>

      <caption><p>Simulation results of the degradation process of a
      screw made of magnesium inside a saline (NaCl) solution, leading
      to a high rate of degradation. The contours display the
      concentration of magnesium ions on a cross-section view of the
      medium beside the moving surface of the screw. The screw was
      selected to be small (1 millimeter) so that the effect of
      degradation can be observed in a smaller time window. Each
      sub-figure shows a time difference of 24 hours. This example is
      provided along with the code.

    <title>Implementation</title>
    <p>Implementing a parallel 3D computational model of the developed
    mathematical framework allows studying the corrosion and
    biodegradation behavior of medical implants and devices
    <italic>in-silico</italic> no matter the complexity of the implant
    shape. This has been achieved by solving the derived system of
    equations using the finite element method on any arbitrary 3D
    mesh.</p>
    <p>The computational model (BioDeg-core) is implemented in FreeFEM
    (<xref alt="Hecht, 2012" rid="ref-Hecht2012" ref-type="bibr">Hecht,
    2012</xref>), a domain-specific language for PDE solving and finite
    element computations. While having a syntax almost identical to C++,
    FreeFEM provides rich interfaces to well-known scientific computing
    libraries for performing relevant tasks such as mesh generation,
    solving linear system of equations, various IO operations, and HPC.
    This fact makes FreeFEM a perfect choice for the implementation of
    complex mathematical models, especially for resource-demanding
    applications. Additionally, a general preprocessor
    (BioDeg-preprocessor) for embedding desired 3D shapes inside a
    container (the medium/electrolyte in biodegradation simulations) is
    implemented in FreeFEM using the ParMmg parallel mesh manipulation
    library
    (<xref alt="Dapogny et al., 2014" rid="ref-Dapogny2014" ref-type="bibr">Dapogny
    et al., 2014</xref>). This helps non-technical users to perform
    simulations on their desired geometries. The preprocessor performs
    mesh refinement on the interface of the implant and the medium to
    increase the numerical accuracy of interface tracking. This mesh
    refinement is based on the level-set function used to measure the
    distance of each element of the mesh to the biodegradable part
    surface. The preprocessor uses this function and a set of
    user-defined values (like the minimum and maximum element size) to
    refine the elements on the moving corrosion front. BioDeg supports
    tetrahedral elements only, which is a limitation routed in supported
    element types in FreeFEM.</p>
    <p>The user interface (BioDeg-UI) is implemented using C++ and Qt
    toolkit. A front-end using Qt and a back-end in FreeFEM enable
    BioDeg to be cross-platform and be able to run on major operating
    systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS. The postprocessing of
    the results is carried out by the open-source software ParaView
    (<xref alt="Ahrens et al., 2005" rid="ref-Ahrens2005" ref-type="bibr">Ahrens
    et al., 2005</xref>), which is also a cross-platform
    postprocessor.</p>

  <sec id="high-performance-computing">
    <title>High-performance computing</title>
    <p>Biodegradation simulations in BioDeg can become complex and
    resource-demanding. The reason lies within the refined mesh on the
    metal-electrolyte interface. This refined mesh is required to
    increase the accuracy of employed numerical schemes to track the
    moving corrosion front
    (<xref alt="Barzegari et al., 2021" rid="ref-barzegari2021" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    et al., 2021</xref>;
    <xref alt="Barzegari &amp; Geris, 2022b" rid="ref-barzegari2022" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    &amp; Geris, 2022b</xref>). This leads to an expensive computational
    model, and as a result, employing parallel computing and HPC
    techniques becomes crucial to make it possible to scale the
    simulations to hundreds or thousands of computational nodes and
    decrease the simulation execution time. To this end, a
    high-performance domain decomposition approach was employed to
    partition the mesh and distribute the workload to available
    computing resources
    (<xref alt="Dolean et al., 2015" rid="ref-Dolean2015" ref-type="bibr">Dolean
    et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, efficient preconditioners and
    solvers were used to solve the linear system of equations resulting
    from the finite element discretization. This was achieved by using
    the rich PETSc library
    (<xref alt="Balay et al., 2019" rid="ref-petsc" ref-type="bibr">Balay
    et al., 2019</xref>), which provides a collection of efficient
    preconditioners and solvers for solving PDEs.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <p>The main prerequisites of BioDeg are FreeFEM, PETSc, Mmg, and an
    MPI runtime (such as OpenMPI or MPICH). The PETSc library contains
    the rest of the dependencies. Since FreeFEM provides appropriate
    interfaces to Mmg and PETSc and includes installation scripts for
    building and installing them, all the requirements can be met by
    building/installing FreeFEM with the PETSc link enabled. While a set
    of pre-built binaries are available for download on the FreeFEM
    website, the user manual of BioDeg includes a section for
    instructing the users to build FreeFEM to achieve maximum
    flexibility on their systems.</p>
    <p>The next step is to build or install the BioDeg UI, the graphical
    user interface of BioDeg. Stable binaries can be downloaded from the
    Release section of the GitHub repository for Windows and Linux, but
    if the user prefers to compile it from source code, the build
    process is straightforward as well. The prerequisites for building
    the UI are Qt framework and CMake, which need to be installed for
    the target operating system. The rest of the process is a standard
    CMake build routine, which can be followed from the installation
    instruction in the BioDeg User Manual or the GitHub repository.
    After building/installing BioDeg UI, the user can run it to setup
    and execute simulations.</p>
    <p>In case the user does not need to work with the UI, like in HPC
    environments or for advanced users, the previous steps for building
    BioDeg-UI can be skipped, and the user can directly run the core
    model by executing
    <monospace>mpiexec -n N FreeFem++-mpi core/src/main.edp -v 0</monospace>
    to parallelize the computation into N MPI processes. In this way,
    the simulation can be configured by dozens of available command-line
    arguments, documented in the BioDeg User Manual.</p>
    <p>For graphical output, the postprocessing of the simulation
    results is handled by ParaView, so the users should have it
    installed on the system. Stable binaries for various platforms can
    be found on the ParaView website, including portable versions which
    do not require installation and are ready to run immediately after
    download. BioDeg UI can help visualize the results by executing
    specific filtering processes in ParaView, which can also be done
    manually by following the postprocessing guideline provided in the
    BioDeg User Manual.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="documentation">
    <title>Documentation</title>
    <p>A comprehensive user manual is provided for user-oriented
    documentation on installing the software, preparing the simulations,
    running the models, and postprocessing the results. As this is being
    developed in a separate repository (BioDeg-doc
    (<xref alt="Barzegari &amp; Geris, 2022a" rid="ref-BioDegDoc" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    &amp; Geris, 2022a</xref>)), additional documents and supporting
    materials will be added eventually.</p>
    <p>Since FreeFEM does not support developer-focused technical
    documentation (like Doxygen), the core code is fully commented for
    easier contribution. Further technical details regarding the
    development, like the theoretical foundations of the computational
    models, has been added to the BioDeg-doc repository
    (<xref alt="Barzegari &amp; Geris, 2022a" rid="ref-BioDegDoc" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    &amp; Geris, 2022a</xref>). Both the user manual and the theory
    guide are accessible from the Help menu on the BioDeg UI.</p>

    <title>Contribution</title>
    <p>BioDeg is developed using a wide range of open-source tools and
    is released under GPLv3, so unconstrained use and reuse are
    encouraged and welcome. The code has been initially developed as
    part of a PhD research project, but further contributions, either on
    the development of the core models or providing more supporting
    materials, are highly welcome. More guidelines for such
    contributions can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the GitHub

  <sec id="published-works">
    <title>Published works</title>
    <p>The code has been already used in publishing 2 scientific works
    so far, and there are several studies ongoing to be prepared for
    publication. In the published works, BioDeg was employed to simulate
    the behavior of high-pure magnesium (HP Mg) in immersion corrosion
    tests
    (<xref alt="Barzegari et al., 2021" rid="ref-barzegari2021" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    et al., 2021</xref>) as well as to evaluate the efficiency and
    scalability of the employed parallelization schemes for
    reaction-diffusion systems with moving boundaries
    (<xref alt="Barzegari &amp; Geris, 2022b" rid="ref-barzegari2022" ref-type="bibr">Barzegari
    &amp; Geris, 2022b</xref>). Currently, the code is being used for
    simulating the degradation of magnesium in hydrodynamics (perfusion)
    conditions, in which the underlying phenomena are investigated in
    the presence of fluid flow. Moreover, BioDeg is being coupled with a
    topology optimization code for optimizing the shape of biodegradable
    structures for medical applications. Later, it will be integrated it
    with an optimization code and bone tissue growth models for
    improving the design process of biodegradable orthopedics
    implants.</p>
