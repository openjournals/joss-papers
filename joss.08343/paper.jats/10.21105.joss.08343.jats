  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The plant modeling platform GroIMP
  (<xref alt="Kniemeyer, 2008" rid="ref-Kniemeyer2008" ref-type="bibr">Kniemeyer,
  2008</xref>), is broadly used by students and researchers to develop
  and run functional structural plant models and analyze their behavior
  and environmental interactions. Its integrated design, which keeps
  modeling, simulation, and analysis in the same graphical user
  interface, makes installation, learning, and modeling easy. However,
  as data size and computing power increased, so did the complexity of
  models, driving the need for integration into external tools and
  remote execution. The GroLink project
  (<xref alt="Oberländer, 2023" rid="ref-oberlander2023grolink" ref-type="bibr">Oberländer,
  2023</xref>;
  <xref alt="Oberländer et al., 2025" rid="ref-oberlander2025grolinkPlugin" ref-type="bibr">Oberländer
  et al., 2025</xref>) created a general HTTP API with additional client
  libraries to answer this need. Using this approach, it is possible to
  run and interact with GroIMP models from other software or devices
  using an extendable set of generalized commands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The GroIMP ecosystem has expanded a lot since the first release 20
  years ago. In some cases, the focus shifted towards creating bigger
  pipelines, or, due to size and complexity, more performant executions
  were needed. From our experience with model developers, modelers,
  educators and their projects, we derived four main directions in
  automatization and integration to focus on.</p>
  <sec id="d-model-provider">
    <title>3D model provider</title>
    <p>Creating 3D models as (intermediate) results of simulations is a
    key feature of GroIMP. Yet direct export to another software is
    currently only possible after the simulation ended
    (<xref alt="Lanwert, 2008" rid="ref-lanwert2008funktions" ref-type="bibr">Lanwert,
    2008</xref>) or via non-interactive file-based approaches. Enabling
    other software to <bold>execute simulation steps</bold> of the model
    and to <bold>export the scene at any time</bold>, would support live
    integration for external interactive visualization (as seen on other
    platforms
    (<xref alt="Fabrika, 2021" rid="ref-fabrika2021interactive" ref-type="bibr">Fabrika,
    2021</xref>)) as well as forwarding structural information
    (<xref alt="Zhu et al., 2021" rid="ref-zhu2021simulating" ref-type="bibr">Zhu
    et al., 2021</xref>). That kind of visualization would allow
    modelers and educators to present interactive results without going
    through the whole modeling environment.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="custom-model-interfaces">
    <title>Custom model interfaces</title>
    <p>There are cases where simpler or more model-specific interfaces
    are needed. Yet creating a new interface for a model is currently
    limited to either an implementation inside the platform
    (<xref alt="Smoleňová et al., 2012" rid="ref-smolevnova2012rule" ref-type="bibr">Smoleňová
    et al., 2012</xref>,
    <xref alt="2013" rid="ref-smolevnovarule" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)
    or an external interface that restarts a non-interactive simulation
    in the background after each input
    (<xref alt="Spehle, 2023" rid="ref-spehleConveyingEffectsClimate" ref-type="bibr">Spehle,
    2023</xref>). To enable real-time external model interfaces, a
    <bold>software independent interactive connection</bold> would be
    required. Therefore, model developers could create custom user
    interfaces, providing a simpler and clearer environment for modelers
    and external users.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="groimp-as-a-service">
    <title>GroIMP as a service</title>
    <p>The idea of providing a file containing a model and set of
    instructions to GroIMP from another software was already introduced
    by the work of Qinqin Long
    (<xref alt="Long et al., 2018" rid="ref-long2018architecture" ref-type="bibr">Long
    et al., 2018</xref>) on the co-simulation with the plant modeling
    platform OpenAlea
    (<xref alt="Pradal et al., 2008" rid="ref-pradal2008openalea" ref-type="bibr">Pradal
    et al., 2008</xref>). Yet this work focused more on the theory of
    co-simulation and model transfer, therefore the integration follows
    a quite strict procedure. A more general integration as a service
    would need an approach that can work <bold>independently from
    specific file formats or scenarios</bold>. This would allow model
    developers to use GroIMP components in models defined on other
    platforms.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="orchestration-of-multiple-simulations">
    <title>Orchestration of multiple simulations</title>
    <p>To automatically execute multiple models, modelers commonly run
    GroIMP headless, i.e. without a graphical interface nor possibility
    of interactions, for each simulation using external scripts
    (<xref alt="Streit et al., 2016" rid="ref-streit2016impact" ref-type="bibr">Streit
    et al., 2016</xref>). However, the headless mode has three main
    limitations. First, it requires additional manual configuration.
    Second, every model execution deploys, configures, and starts the
    platform. Finally, it is non-interactive. Thus it is more complex to
    adapt the orchestration based on intermediate feedback (having a
    “user in the loop”).</p>
    <p>An HTTP server
    (<xref alt="Kniemeyer, 2008" rid="ref-Kniemeyer2008" ref-type="bibr">Kniemeyer,
    2008</xref>;
    <xref alt="Lanwert, 2008" rid="ref-lanwert2008funktions" ref-type="bibr">Lanwert,
    2008</xref>) was added to GroIMP to resolve the second limitation.
    However, it still does not provide means of interacting with the
    model and requires not only additional configuration in the model
    but also technical expertise.</p>
    <p>Therefore, an improved solution needs to allow modelers to easily
    execute several simulations on a running instance <bold>in parallel
    while being able to interact</bold> with them <bold>without
    additional implementation</bold> on the simulation. The main
    audience for this would be modelers, running parameterized
    experiments such as sensitivity analysis.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="related-projects">
    <title>Related projects</title>
    <p>When considering other software projects with a similar focus on
    developing functional structural plant models, it becomes clear that
    different software architectures present different challenges. Most
    other approaches, such as OpenAlea
    (<xref alt="Pradal et al., 2008" rid="ref-pradal2008openalea" ref-type="bibr">Pradal
    et al., 2008</xref>) or Virtual plant lab
    (<xref alt="Morales et al., 2025" rid="ref-morales2025virtual" ref-type="bibr">Morales
    et al., 2025</xref>), are created as libraries rather than as
    standalone platforms. With this design, part of the library is
    considered the “API,” enabling integration into larger projects,
    provided the programming languages are compatible. In order to link
    these projects to incompatible platforms or remote systems and
    additional layer would be required.</p>
  </sec>

<sec id="grolink">
  <title>GroLink</title>
  <p>The GroLink project
  (<xref alt="Oberländer et al., 2025" rid="ref-oberlander2025grolinkPlugin" ref-type="bibr">Oberländer
  et al., 2025</xref>), as presented in Tim Oberländer’s Master’s thesis
  (<xref alt="Oberländer, 2023" rid="ref-oberlander2023grolink" ref-type="bibr">Oberländer,
  2023</xref>), adds a non-blocking HTTP server to GroIMP, which
  provides a stateless API. The design uses the fact that each project
  (workbench) runs independently on its thread and that any interaction
  is done through predefined commands. For each request, the API server
  pushes the referenced command to the specified workbench for
  execution.</p>
  <p>This design was chosen based on the discussion above:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Software independence is given by the usage of HTTP.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Id-based addressing of workbenches allows for parallel
      interactive simulation.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>By using commands, quite general access to GroIMP’s
      functionalities is provided.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>As the interaction mimics the GUI, changes to the model are
      rarely necessary.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>The API server is an independent implementation that should not be
  confused with the embedded HTTP server. The predefined commands are
  divided into two categories: application commands for managing
  workbenches and workbench commands for interacting with loaded
  projects. With a few exceptions, input parameters are provided in the
  HTTP query, and the results are JSON-formatted text. For workbench
  commands, the result includes the current content of the project’s
  logs and console. The server’s openAPI specification can be found in
  the repository and accessed through the API.</p>
  <p>We created additional libraries in Python
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp-utils/pythonapilibrary">GroPy</ext-link>)
  and R
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp-utils/rapilibrary">GroR</ext-link>)
  to simplify interacting with the server and individual projects.</p>
  <sec id="installation-and-usage">
    <title>Installation and usage</title>
    <p>GroLink can be installed directly from within GroIMP through the
    plugin manager. To start the software as an API server the
    additional command-line argument “<monospace>-a api</monospace>” is
    required, as explained in the repository
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp-plugins/api/-/blob/master/docs/starting_the_api.md">docs/starting_the_api.md</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>To send requests to the running API server a web browser or a
    client library can be used, tutorials and install instructions can
    be found in the repository
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp-plugins/api/-/blob/master/docs/Getting_started_with_HTTP.md">docs/Getting_started_with_HTTP.md</ext-link>).</p>

  <title>Examples</title>
  <p>We created three different client projects aiming in the directions
  we considered above. All three projects and more examples are
  available on Gitlab:
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/groimp-api-examples">https://gitlab.com/groimp-api-examples</ext-link>.</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p>To demonstrate automation and management of external resources,
      we created a simple light simulation pipeline. This pipeline
      consists of importing a 3D model into GroIMP; running a light
      simulation; coloring model parts based on the absorbed radiation;
      and exporting the resulting 3D model. It was implemented as a
      GroPy-based script that can be executed from commandline.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>To highlight simulation-level interactions between GroIMP and
      other commonly used software, we implemented two interactive
      RShiny web applications. The first is a generalized interactive
      viewer for any GroIMP model. The second is an interface to
      manipulate the environment of a specific plant model and observe
      its reactions. These examples were implemented using GroR and also
      shows the possibility of using custom UI for GroIMP.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>To test live client side manipulations of the 3D scene, we
      linked three different forest models to a Godot game
      (<xref alt="Godot, n.d." rid="ref-godotengineGodotEngine" ref-type="bibr">Godot,
      n.d.</xref>). In this game a user can walk through the forest, cut
      or plant trees, and trigger growth steps which are then simulated
      in GroIMP and pushed back to the game. This example also shows
      that the API can be used by any kind of http client.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
</sec>
<sec id="discussion">
  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>The presented project shows potential to improve GroIMP usage in
  all four discussed areas, as demonstrated by the examples. The first
  three improvements are significant because such usage was nearly
  impossible before. Regarding orchestration, even though it was
  previously possible, two improvements can be noted: first, interaction
  with an automatically called model is now possible; and second, the
  client libraries and API structure ease the usage for modelers with
  little coding experience.</p>
