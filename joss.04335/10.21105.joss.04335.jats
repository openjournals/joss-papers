  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Distinguishing between spatial entities is fundamental in
  archaeology since archaeologists deal with spatial phenomena at
  multiple scales of analysis. During an excavation, objects are
  discovered within various types of spatial units e.g., stratigraphic
  layers, pits, hearths and houses. Spatial units are far from being raw
  data, and the identification and determination of their boundaries is
  the result of conjoint lines and methods of investigation, to name
  only a few: field observations, geoarchaeology, sedimentology, and the
  study of archaeological “refits”. Refitting fragments belonged to the
  same object at some moment in the past. More precisely, archaeologists
  deduce former connection relationships from the symmetry and the
  possibility of contact of significantly large surface areas from two
  fragments, which can be physically adjusted (the fragments “refit”).
  Here, “connection” is used as a shorthand to refer to the connection
  relationship that existed in the past between two areas of an object
  before they were broken into fragments. Archaeological refitting
  analysis has several aims:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p>to reconstruct objects,</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>to determine technical sequences (e.g., stone tool
      manufacture), and</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>to determine the reliability of spatial units and their
      possible admixture due to pre- and post-depositional
      processes.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>This analysis has long been used for the latter aim, benefiting
  from multiple methodological improvements (for an overview, see
  Cziesla et al.
  (<xref alt="1990" rid="ref-CzieslaEtal1990" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>),
  Schurmans &amp; De Bie
  (<xref alt="2007" rid="ref-SchurmansDebie2007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>)).
  These methods have relied on the comparison between the number of
  refits between different spatial units and within these units.
  However, it has been demonstrated that considering the number of
  refits without considering their topology can lead to misleading
  interpretations. A method, coined TSAR “Topological Study of
  Archaeological Refitting”, was developed to overcome this issue using
  graph theory to model the topology of the relations between fragments
  (Plutniak
  (<xref alt="2021b" rid="ref-Plutniak2021jas" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>),
  Plutniak
  (<xref alt="2022b" rid="ref-Plutniak2022bspf" ref-type="bibr">2022b</xref>)).
  This renewed approach distinguishes between ambiguous cases
  (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Ascheme">Figure 1</xref>), and is
  much more robust and less sensitive to the lack of information than
  count-based methods, thus resulting in a more accurate evaluation of
  the reliability of the boundaries between spatial units.
  <monospace>Archeofrag</monospace> is an R package
  (<xref alt="R Core Team, 2021" rid="ref-Rcoreteam2021" ref-type="bibr">R

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The use of R in archaeology has increased slowly albeit constantly,
  during the last two decades. However, the development of R packages
  for specific archaeological needs is an even more recent phenomenon.
  Only a few packages are available for spatial analysis in archaeology,
  notably for stratigraphic analysis:</p>

  (<xref alt="Carey et al., 2020" rid="ref-CareyEtal2020" ref-type="bibr">Carey

  <p><monospace>Archeofrag</monospace> has six main sets of

    <p>The fragmentation graphs are visualised as node-and-edge

    <title>Boundary-related statistics: measuring the cohesion and
    admixture of two spatial units</title>
    <p>Evaluating the consistency of spatial units and their division
    from refits is the first aim of the
    <monospace>Archeofrag</monospace> package. Evaluation follows a
    three-step procedure, implemented in three related functions:</p>
    <list list-type="order">
      <list-item>
        <p>Weighting the edges. Three parameters can be combined: the
        topology of the connection relationships (mandatory), the size
        of the two connected fragments (optional), and the spatial
        distance between the location where they were found (optional).
        The optional parameters implement the hypothesis that two large
        fragments found far from each other suggest more disturbance in
        the site than two small fragments found very close together (see
        an application and details in
        <xref alt="Caro et al., 2022" rid="ref-CaroEtal2022" ref-type="bibr">Caro
        et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Measuring the internal cohesion of each spatial unit
        (intuitively, how they are “self-adherent” to themselves)</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Measuring the admixture of two spatial units (a summary
        statistic based on two cohesion values)</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>Cohesion and admixture values are computed by pairs of spatial
    units. Results for cohesion measurements range between [0;1], with
    values towards 0 for low cohesion and towards 1 for high cohesion,
    with their sum never being superior to 1 for a pair of layers.
    Results for admixture measurements range between [0;1].</p>

  <sec id="spatial-unit-related-statistics-fragmentation-patterns-technology-human-behaviour">
    <title>Spatial unit-related statistics: fragmentation patterns,
    technology, human behaviour</title>
    <p>The second aim of the TSAR method implemented in
    <monospace>Archeofrag</monospace> is to characterise spatial units
    based on the topological properties of the connection relationships
    between the fragments they contain. Several functions are provided
    for this purpose, selected for their relevance in the archaeological
    context, namely cycle count, path length, and component diameter (a
    component is related to an initial object).</p>
    <p>The archaeological interpretation of the numerical values depends
    on the type of object (lithic, pottery, etc.) and their completeness
    or incompleteness. These values can suggest specific behaviours
    related to the production or use of the objects (intentional
    breaking), and post-depositional processes (natural breaking,
    scattering). This aspect of the TSAR method will be further
    developed in the future.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="simulation-of-fragmentation-graphs">
    <title>Simulation of fragmentation graphs</title>
    <p>The simulation function generates connected fragments scattered
    within one or two spatial units (see Plutniak
    (<xref alt="2021b" rid="ref-Plutniak2021jas" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>)
    for details). It can be set with multiple parameters:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p>Number of initial objects or fragments.</p>
      </list-item>

        <p>Final number of fragments.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Final number of connection relationships.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Proportion of fragments in each spatial unit, before
        post-depositional processes.</p>

        <p>Proportion of components in each spatial unit.</p>
      </list-item>

        <p>Proportion of fragments likely to move from a spatial unit to
        the other one.</p>

        spatial unit 2.</p>

      <list-item>
        <p>When applying fragmentation, increase the likelihood for
        objects with more fragments being selected.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Number of initial hypothetical spatial unit.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Whether generating only planar graphs.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>Generating only planar graphs is interesting since this
    corresponds to the fragmentation observed in some specific
    archaeological contexts (e.g., pottery with simple shapes, small
    sets of refits). However, the run time of this function is doubled
    when this constraint is used.</p>
