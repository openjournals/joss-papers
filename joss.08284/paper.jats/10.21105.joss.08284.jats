  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>OpenSim Creator is an open-source integrated graphical interface
  that lowers the barrier to building and evaluating musculoskeletal
  models in OpenSim, which often required editing XML files or custom
  code. This paper describes the architecture and features of OpenSim
  Creator and demonstrates its application in developing new
  musculoskeletal models.</p>

  <xref alt="Demuth et al., 2023" rid="ref-DemuthU003A2023" ref-type="bibr">Demuth
  et al., 2023</xref>) studies. However, creating a musculoskeletal
  model remains labor-intensive and technically demanding because it
  requires the careful integration of biological data, biomedical
  images, mesh editing tools, model/data file formats, and
  musculoskeletal anatomy.</p>
  <p>For example, building a biomechanical model of a dinosaur involves
  3D scanning fossils, segmenting/registering bones, identifying
  reference frames and muscle attachments, rigging/articulating skeletal
  structures, reconstructing musculature, and running biomechanical
  simulations
  (<xref alt="Bishop et al., 2021" rid="ref-BishopU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">Bishop
  et al., 2021</xref>). Such workflows often need to be repeated for
  different subjects or specimens and may require dynamic simulation of
  the model to ensure it is balanced and has stable dynamics. While
  scaling existing models can reduce this effort, developing robust and
  unbiased scaling procedures that handle diverse shapes, injuries, or
  deformities remains challenging
  (<xref alt="van der Kruk, 2025" rid="ref-vanDerKrukU003A2025" ref-type="bibr">van
  der Kruk, 2025</xref>); therefore, real-time visual feedback during
  model building, dynamic simulation, and scaling is a powerful feature
  for model creation, verification, and validation.</p>
  <p>The lack of graphical tools not only affects research but also
  limits accessibility for students and new researchers learning
  musculoskeletal modeling. As OpenSim’s use expands beyond biomechanics
  (e.g., medicine, paleobiology), and open education becomes more
  widespread (e.g., online and open courses
  (<xref alt="Weller et al., 2018" rid="ref-WellerU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Weller
  et al., 2018</xref>)), there is a growing need for open-source,
  visual, and easy-to-install tools that educators can use to teach
  musculoskeletal model-building concepts clearly — tools that lower
  barriers to entry compared to traditional code- or
  biomechanics-focused workflows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="state-of-the-field">
  <title>State of the Field</title>
  <p>Similar model creation and editing challenges are addressed in
  fields such as 3D design (e.g., Blender
  (<xref alt="Blender, 2018" rid="ref-Blender" ref-type="bibr">Blender,
  2018</xref>)), engineering (e.g., FreeCAD
  (<xref alt="FreeCAD, 2002" rid="ref-FreeCAD" ref-type="bibr">FreeCAD,
  2002</xref>)), and game development (e.g., Godot
  (<xref alt="Godot, 2014" rid="ref-Godot" ref-type="bibr">Godot,
  2014</xref>)). Engineers commonly use these software tools to reduce
  labor by automating actions such as 3D object placement. They also
  enhance user expertise by enabling model editing in a safe, undoable
  environment with immediate visual feedback.</p>
  <p>OpenSim includes a user interface (UI) that can edit the parameters
  of existing OpenSim models, but it is specialized around tools that
  accept existing model files as input. For example, it includes tools
  for scaling models, computing inverse kinematics (IK) from marker
  motion recordings, and computed muscle control (CMC,
  (<xref alt="Thelen &amp; Anderson, 2006" rid="ref-ThelenU003A2006" ref-type="bibr">Thelen
  &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>)), but it does not include tools for
  adding bodies or joints to an existing model. Therefore, to create new
  models, users typically use a combination of the following three
  options:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Manually write the model file (XML)</bold>: The majority
      of models used by the OpenSim community were created by the
      development team by manually editing OpenSim model files (.osim
      files, XML format). It is possible to build any model this way,
      but it requires knowledge of and expertise with OpenSim’s data
      structures. For average end-users, it is highly error-prone
      because it does not provide immediate or visual feedback.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Use code/libraries to customize a model</bold>: Examples
      include the MAP Client
      (<xref alt="Zhang et al., 2014" rid="ref-BesierU003A2014" ref-type="bibr">Zhang
      et al., 2014</xref>), Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling Pipeline
      (<xref alt="Hammond et al., 2025" rid="ref-HammondU003A2025" ref-type="bibr">Hammond
      et al., 2025</xref>), and Muscle Parameter Optimizer
      (<xref alt="Modenese et al., 2016" rid="ref-ModeneseU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Modenese
      et al., 2016</xref>). These are powerful tools to make existing
      models more representative of individuals, but they typically do
      not enable the creation of new models.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Use visual tools that can export OpenSim models</bold>:
      Examples include NMSBuilder
      (<xref alt="Valente et al., 2017" rid="ref-ValenteU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Valente
      et al., 2017</xref>) and MuSkeMo
      (<xref alt="Bijlert, 2024" rid="ref-BijlertU003A2024" ref-type="bibr">Bijlert,
      2024</xref>). These visual tools manipulate a separate data
      structure exported to OpenSim and do not support direct editing,
      viewing, or simulation in-UI.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>There remains a need for an integrated UI that supports real-time
  model development, live simulation, and displays key quantities (e.g.,
  muscle moment arms, force vectors) directly from the OpenSim API
  during editing without export or translation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="design-principles-and-architecture">
  <title>Design Principles and Architecture</title>
  <p>We surveyed open-source tools (e.g., Blender
  (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-Blender" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)) to
  identify common design and architectural patterns. We found that, in
  most cases, they focus on providing immediate visual feedback whenever
  a user performs an action and are continuously improved over many
  releases. Immediate feedback is typically achieved by integrating the
  UI directly with the underlying model/state, rather than through
  indirect mechanisms such as remote procedure calls (RPCs) or export
  steps. Based on these observations, and our prior experience with
  OpenSim, we decided that OpenSim Creator’s architecture should focus
  on the following four key requirements:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Enable responsive editing performance</bold>: supports
      interactive model editing and fast visual feedback.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Provide low-level UI control</bold>: supports a highly
      customized user experience. Specialized tasks in biomechanical
      model building (e.g., landmark placement, mesh reorientation, mesh
      warping, real-time data visualization) may require low-level
      control over the rendering process.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Directly integrate with the OpenSim API</bold>: provides
      on-demand access to the OpenSim component API. This enables a wide
      variety of features, such as the ability to add and edit
      components in the UI, or show biomechanical quantities (e.g.,
      muscle lengths, moment arms) during editing/simulation.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Support iterative software and model development</bold>:
      facilitates rapid prototyping and feedback from the research
      community.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>To meet these requirements, OpenSim Creator draws inspiration from
  the games industry, which prioritizes rapid prototyping and real-time
  rendering. Architecturally, we combine C++ for direct and
  high-performance OpenSim API integration, a custom OpenGL renderer for
  real-time 3D editing, and Dear ImGui
  (<xref alt="Cornut, 2014" rid="ref-ImGui" ref-type="bibr">Cornut,
  2014</xref>) for a customizable low-level 2D UI toolkit. Additionally,
  real model-building challenges from our own research heavily informed
  OpenSim Creator’s design and architecture, ensuring that practical
  workflows were supported.</p>
  <p>Organizationally, we adopted an open iterative development
  methodology. All releases of OpenSim Creator have been available on
  GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license from the first month of
  development, with new releases every 1–2 months. We have continuously
  received and incorporated feedback from the research community over 36
  release cycles. To further support adoption and educational use,
  OpenSim Creator includes fully documented tutorials written using
  Sphinx that guide users with no prior OpenSim experience through model
  construction and interactive visualization. These resources allow
  students and new researchers to quickly learn musculoskeletal modeling
  concepts, explore workflows hands-on, and leverage OpenSim Creator’s
  real-time features.</p>

  <p><xref alt="[fig:1]" rid="figU003A1">[fig:1]</xref> and
  <xref alt="[fig:2]" rid="figU003A2">[fig:2]</xref> illustrate some of
  the interactive workflows in OpenSim Creator. While it is challenging
  to quantify every feature in this article, users benefit from the
  following capabilities:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Live-reload of the underlying .osim file</bold>: OpenSim
      Creator automatically reloads the model file from disk whenever it
      detects changes. This enables seamless integration with existing
      workflows, including manual XML edits, script-based modifications,
      or edits performed in the OpenSim UI.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Live muscle plots</bold>: OpenSim Creator can plot muscle
      quantities (e.g., moment arm, fiber length) that automatically
      update whenever the model is edited–either via OpenSim Creator or
      via external tools. Users can overlay curves from CSV files on
      these plots, making it easier to create models that match
      experimental measurements.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Output watches</bold>: The OpenSim API provides an
      “outputs” abstraction, allowing each model component to declare
      quantities of interest (e.g., a body’s center of mass, a joint’s
      reaction force, etc.). OpenSim Creator displays these outputs in
      real-time during editing and dynamic simulation, providing
      essential insight into model behavior.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <fig>

    rigging meshes in a free-form editor, b) the mesh warper workflow,
    which focuses on placing corresponding landmarks on meshes (left and
    middle) with real-time updates to a Thin-Plate Spline
    (<xref alt="Bookstein, 1989" rid="ref-BooksteinU003A1989" ref-type="bibr">Bookstein,

    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="fig1.png" />
  </fig>
  <p>These features accelerate the model-building process and illustrate
  the value of OpenSim Creator’s software architecture: the direct
  connection between the OpenSim API and the UI ensures that user
  interactions immediately update visualizations and model outputs.</p>
  <p>These interactive features rely on a highly responsive rendering
  engine. OpenSim Creator maintains real-time performance, typically
  running smoothly - even when manipulating complex models on modest
  hardware (e.g., Rajagopal et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-RajagopalU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  on an Intel Core i5 MacBook Air 2020). This responsiveness ensures
  that live muscle plots, output watches, and mesh manipulations remain
  smooth and immediate, allowing users to focus on model construction
  rather than waiting for visual updates. The tight coupling between the
  UI and the OpenSim API is key to achieving this performance, avoiding
  indirect refresh mechanisms such as export/reload cycles or RPCs.</p>
  <p>OpenSim Creator is primarily intended for interactive model
  construction, visualization, and direct inspection of biomechanical
  quantities. Its UI enables instant feedback during editing, supporting
  exploration and rapid iteration. Once a model is constructed, users
  can use the .osim file with other tools or scripts in the OpenSim
  ecosystem for simulation, analysis, or integration with experimental
  data. OpenSim Creator facilitates hands-on model construction, while
  downstream analyses leverage the broader OpenSim ecosystem.</p>

  <title>Illustrative Use Cases</title>
  <p>Subject-specific models are necessary because all individuals are
  unique and can have a wide variety of injuries and deformities. In one
  project, our goal was to create a subject-specific model of a human
  shoulder. Using OpenSim Creator’s mesh importer UI
  (<xref alt="[fig:1]" rid="figU003A1">[fig:1]</xref>a), a previously
  published
  (<xref alt="Seth et al., 2019" rid="ref-SethU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Seth
  et al., 2019</xref>) generic shoulder model was used as a template by
  superimposing it over subject-specific bone meshes from CT scans. The
  UI enabled real-time, free-form placement and orientation of the
  subject-specific joints and bodies. Muscle volumes from
  subject-specific MRI data were then combined with moment arm data from
  the generic model to create a line of action for each muscle in the
  model. OpenSim Creator’s model editor UI provided real-time visual
  feedback about how each muscle’s moment arm was affected by the
  placement of attachment points and wrapping surfaces on the muscle’s
  line of action within the model
  (<xref alt="[fig:2]" rid="figU003A2">[fig:2]</xref>).</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>A screenshot of OpenSim Creator’s model editor UI,
    showing a subject-specific human shoulder model created within the
    editor. The model editor can host multiple panels, each of which is
    updated whenever the user edits the model. For example, the muscle
    plotter (right) can be used to show how a muscle’s moment arm
    changes as a user edits the muscle in the 3D viewport (middle) or in
    the properties panel
    (left).<styled-content id="figU003A2"></styled-content></p></caption>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Model creation is a complex, multistep, and iterative process that
  is best served by realistic, fast, and interactive visual feedback. By
  combining a rapid-prototyping architecture inspired by the games
  industry with a development approach that continuously incorporates
  feedback from the biomechanical research community, we designed and
  developed a graphical UI that enables the creation and evaluation of
  OpenSim models more quickly and easily.</p>
  <p>OpenSim Creator’s architecture supports rendering multiple
  high-vertex-count bone models in real time on a MacBook Air (2020,
  Intel Core i5). Its customizable UI allows researchers to build models
  visually, and its tight integration with the OpenSim API provides
  immediate feedback on biomechanical quantities such as muscle moment
  arms. Anecdotally, master’s students using OpenSim Creator in a
  musculoskeletal modeling course, as well as researchers from the
  broader community, have reported reduced time and effort to construct,
  edit, and evaluate models compared to traditional workflows, including
  XML editing or script-based approaches. These models included complex
  musculature, multiple joints, and subject-specific anatomical
  variation, demonstrating that OpenSim Creator can handle realistic
  research-level scenarios efficiently.</p>
  <p>Beyond research, OpenSim Creator has proven valuable in educational
  settings. It has been used in student courses, supported by fully
  documented tutorials that guide users with no prior OpenSim experience
  through model construction and visualization. This hands-on approach
  teaches musculoskeletal modeling concepts while lowering barriers to
  entry, providing immediate visual feedback, and removing the need for
  prior coding or engineering expertise.</p>
  <p>Looking forward, OpenSim Creator will continue to evolve, with
  plans to support specialized workflows such as visually-assisted model
  warping, real-time sensor visualization, and the import of diverse
  biomedical data. These developments, combined with ongoing
  improvements to the core user experience, will further streamline
  model creation from medical imaging and emerging anatomical data,
  making OpenSim Creator a versatile tool for both research and
  education.</p>
