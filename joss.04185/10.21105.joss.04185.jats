  <title>Summary</title>
  <p><monospace>Synaptus</monospace> is a toolbox made for focusing
  ultrasound images. It can, however, also be used on data acquired
  using similar imaging principles, e.g. sonar and radar images.</p>
  <p>Ultrasonic imaging is performed by transmitting sound waves into an
  object and recording how the waves are scattered. In many
  applications, transmission and recording are performed with the same
  unit, a <italic>transducer</italic>. If a single transducer is used,
  each measurement produces a vector representing the backscattered
  waves at a given location. By moving the transducer relative to the
  object of interest, a 2D or 3D map of reflections can be created.</p>
  <p>Transducer elements can be stacked along a line or on a grid to
  create transducer <italic>arrays</italic>. By manipulating how signals
  are transmitted by each individual element, different shaped waves can
  be created, e.g. a plane wave, or a wave focused at a point. The
  spatial distribution of the elements also enables recording of a 2D or
  3D map of reflections without moving the array as a whole.</p>
  <p>The recordings of scattered waves represent raw data, both for
  single-transducer and array imaging setups. This data often suffers
  from poor resolution, making it hard (if not impossible) to interpret
  directly. The data needs to be focused in order to create an image
  resembling the physical structure of an object. This process -
  creating focused images from raw pulse-echo ultrasound data - is the
  purpose of the <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> toolbox.</p>
  <p>Sonic imaging is used in many different applications, such as
  geophysical imaging, sonar imaging, medical imaging, and
  non-destructive testing (NDT) of industrial components. The methods
  and algorithms used in these fields are similar in many ways, but
  there are also significant differences in hardware, scale, and
  physical properties of the objects that are imaged. The software
  presented here was originally written as part of a PhD thesis on
  <bold>ultrasound imaging for non-destructive testing</bold>
  (<xref alt="Skjelvareid, 2012" rid="ref-Skjelvareid2012b" ref-type="bibr">Skjelvareid,
  2012</xref>).</p>
  <p>The thesis focused on three main points:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Processing data in the Fourier domain (faster and sometimes
      simpler than processing in the time-space domain)</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Adapting single-layer algorithms to multi-layered media,
      e.g. water and metal</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Adapting algorithms originally made for Cartesian coordinates
      to cylindrical coordinates (better suited for imaging pipes from
      the inside)</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>The thesis is included in the repository and contains a full list
  of references. However, the most important ones will be highlighted
  here: <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> was greatly inspired by previous
  work by Tomas Olofsson and Tadeusz Stepinski at Uppsala University
  Stepinski
  (<xref alt="2007" rid="ref-Stepinski2007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).
  The underlying theory (mainly phase shift migration and Stolt
  migration) was originally developed for geophysical imaging
  (<xref alt="Gazdag, 1978" rid="ref-Gazdag1978" ref-type="bibr">Gazdag,
  1978</xref>;
  <xref alt="Stolt, 1978" rid="ref-Stolt1978" ref-type="bibr">Stolt,
  1978</xref>), and the free book and software on exploration seismology
  available through CREWES
  (<xref alt="Margrave, 2021" rid="ref-crewes_toolbox_2021" ref-type="bibr">Margrave,
  2021</xref>) was also very helpful during software development. An
  extended (not free) version of the book is also available
  (<xref alt="Margrave &amp; Lamoureux, 2019" rid="ref-margrave_lamoureux_2019" ref-type="bibr">Margrave
  &amp; Lamoureux, 2019</xref>). Finally, the book “Fourier Acoustics”
  by E.G. Williams
  (<xref alt="Williams, 1999" rid="ref-Williams1999" ref-type="bibr">Williams,
  1999</xref>) was essential in developing the theory for cylindrical
  imaging geometries.</p>

<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p><monospace>Synaptus</monospace> is a Matlab / Octave toolbox for
  creating focused images from raw ultrasonic data using the concept of
  synthetic aperture. The core algorithms have been written as a small
  set of functions that can handle many different types of datasets (2D
  / 3D data, single- or multilayered media, Cartesian or cylindrical
  geometries). The code is highly vectorized, taking advantage of
  optimized libraries for linear algebra in Matlab / Octave. In
  addition, the algorithms operate in the Fourier domain, which in many
  cases is more computationally efficient than operating in the
  time-space domain (“delay-and-sum”).</p>
  <p>The toolbox includes a number of scripts that test the core
  algorithms by running them on a set of relevant datasets. The datasets
  represent a valuable resource in themselves, given that there are very
  few publicly available NDT ultrasound datasets. The datasets can
  e.g. be used as benchmarks by researchers working on new
  algorithms.</p>
  <p>The core algorithms are written to be efficient and flexible.
  However, the code may not be easy to understand for researchers who
  are not yet familiar with the theory. To accommodate those wanting to
  better understand the concepts, a set of scripts with simplified
  algorithms have been included. These scripts also produce figures
  showing raw data, intermediate steps and final focused images.</p>
  <p><monospace>Synaptus</monospace> has been available on GitHub and
  Mathworks File Exchange (MFE) since 2016. At the time of writing it
  has been downloaded over 1000 times from MFE, and 9 out of 10
  reviewers have rated it 5 out of 5 stars. The author has also been
  contacted directly by researchers who have found the toolbox useful,
  including:</p>

      (<xref alt="Barbante, 2021" rid="ref-beyond_epica" ref-type="bibr">Barbante,

  <p>A number of open source toolboxes related to ultrasound imaging are
  publicly available, including e.g. Field II
  (<xref alt="Jensen, 2021" rid="ref-field2" ref-type="bibr">Jensen,
  2021</xref>), K-wave
  (<xref alt="Nikolov, 2020" rid="ref-kwave" ref-type="bibr">Nikolov,
  2020</xref>) and the UltraSound ToolBox
  (<xref alt="Rodriguez-Molares et al., 2017" rid="ref-rodriguez2017" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Molares
  et al., 2017</xref>). However, most such toolboxes focus on medical
  applications, and none (to my knowledge) have implementations of the
  algorithms in the <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> toolbox.</p>
  <p>The concept of synthetic aperture focusing used in
  <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> can be used for several modes of
  imaging, but the most well-known is probably synthetic aperture radar
  (SAR) satellite imaging. This is a huge field, both commercially and
  academically, and there are multiple open source software packages
  related to processing of SAR data available, e.g. OSARIS
  (<xref alt="Loibl et al., 2019" rid="ref-osaris" ref-type="bibr">Loibl
  et al., 2019</xref>) and SNAP
  (<xref alt="Zuhlke et al., 2015" rid="ref-snap" ref-type="bibr">Zuhlke
  et al., 2015</xref>). However, such packages are often highly
  specialized for processing of radar data, making them hard to apply to
  other types of pulse-echo data (e.g. ultrasonic). SAR imaging is also
  limited to the case of a single propagating medium (vacuum/air), and
  SAR processors can therefore not be applied to the multilayer case
  that <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> addresses.</p>
  <p>Although the toolbox was first published as a collection of
  algorithms and datasets developed during a PhD program, the repository
  is intended to be an open and live development project. Contributions
  in the form of datasets from new imaging geometries (e.g. differently
  shaped arrays or layered media) are particularly welcome, as they
  provide the foundation for developing algorithms for these geometries.
  However, contributions in the form of code, feature requests or issue
  reports are all very much appreciated. Given the popularity and
  availability of Python, a Python implementation of the toolbox
  algorithms is also seen as a natural continuation of the project.</p>

  <title>Example use</title>
  <p>The following example was originally presented in
  (<xref alt="Skjelvareid et al., 2012" rid="ref-Skjelvareid2012c" ref-type="bibr">Skjelvareid
  et al., 2012</xref>), and is included here to give a more visual and
  intuitive sense of how <monospace>Synaptus</monospace> can create a
  focused image from raw ultrasonic data. For the sake of brevity, only
  a short description is given here, but the full details of the
  experiment can be found in
  (<xref alt="Skjelvareid, 2012" rid="ref-Skjelvareid2012b" ref-type="bibr">Skjelvareid,
  2012</xref>).</p>
  <p>Test blocks made of acrylic glass and aluminum were manufactured
  for the experiment. Each block had four flat-bottom holes with 3 mm
  diameter, spaced 20 mm apart. Such holes constitute point-like
  scatterers during ultrasonic imaging, and enable direct evaluation of
  the performance of focusing algorithms. The blocks were immersed in
  water, and the imaging geometry as a whole thus consisted of three
  layers with distinct sound wave velocities; 1480 m/s, 2730 m/s and
  6320 m/s for water, acrylic glass and aluminum, respectively. The test
  blocks were imaged using a single 2.25 MHZ, 6 mm transducer, with a 1
  mm spatial sampling interval. The imaging geometry is shown in Figure
  1 and 2.</p>
  <p>The raw data from the ultrasonic scan is shown in Figure 3, with
  isosurfaces generated based on the responses from the flat-bottom
  holes. The image shows how the response from each hole is fairly
  broad, especially in the lowest layer. This effect is due to the width
  of the ultrasonic beam increasing with depth.</p>
  <p>Figure 4 shows the focused image after processing the raw data with
  the PSM algorithm in <monospace>Synaptus</monospace>, visualized in
  the same way as the raw data. The image shows how the responses from
  flat-bottom holes are much narrower, indicating a higher lateral
  resolution in the focused image. The resolution is also independent of
  depth. This is a well-known feature of synthetic aperture focusing, of
  which the PSM algorithm is an example.</p>
