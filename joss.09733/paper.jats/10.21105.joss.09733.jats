  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists
  use advanced microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure,
  while theorists and computational scientists develop models that link
  processing, structure, and properties. Bridging these domains is
  essential for inverse material design, where you start from desired
  performance and work backwards to optimal microstructures and
  manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging with
  predictive simulations and data‐driven optimization accelerates
  discovery and deepens understanding of process–structure–property
  relationships.</p>

      <p>Its modular design includes comprehensive convergence tests to

  </list>
  <p>While not intended to replace general finite-element or
  multi-physics platforms, it fills a unique niche for high-resolution
  voxel workflows, rapid prototyping for structure simulations and
  materials design, and fully open, reproducible pipelines that bridge
  imaging, modeling, and data-driven optimization.</p>
  <p>At a high level, evoxels is organized around two core abstractions:
  VoxelFields and VoxelGrid. VoxelFields provides a uniform, NumPy-based
  container for any number of 3D fields on the same regular grid,
  maximizing interoperability with image I/O libraries (e.g., tifffile,
  h5py, napari
  (<xref alt="napari contributors, 2019" rid="ref-napari" ref-type="bibr">napari
  contributors, 2019</xref>), scikit-image
  (<xref alt="Walt et al., 2014" rid="ref-scimage" ref-type="bibr">Walt
  et al., 2014</xref>)) and visualization tools (e.g., PyVista
  (<xref alt="Sullivan &amp; Kaszynski, 2019" rid="ref-sullivan2019pyvista" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan
  &amp; Kaszynski, 2019</xref>) for visualization and VTK export).
  VoxelGrid couples these fields to either a PyTorch or JAX backend,
  offering pre-defined boundary conditions, finite difference stencils,
  and FFT libraries as sketched in
  <xref alt="[fig:evoxels-code-logic]" rid="figU003Aevoxels-code-logic">[fig:evoxels-code-logic]</xref>.
  The implemented solvers leverage advanced Fourier spectral
  timesteppers (e.g., semi-implicit, exponential integrators),
  on-the-fly plotting, and integrated wall-time and RAM profiling. A
  suite of predefined PDE “problems” (e.g., Cahn–Hilliard,
  reaction-diffusion, multi-phase evolution) can be solved out of the
  box or extended via user-defined ODE classes with custom right-hand
  sides. Integrated convergence tests ensure that each discretization
  achieves the expected order before it is applied to real microscopy
  data.</p>
  <fig>
    <caption><p>Visualisation of package concept. The VoxelFields class
    acts as the user interface for organising 3D fields on a regular
    grid, including plotting and export functions. Solvers are assembled
    in a modular fashion. The chosen timestepper and ODE class are
    just-in-time compiled (green becomes a single kernel) based on the
    specified VoxelGrid
    backend.<styled-content id="figU003Aevoxels-code-logic"></styled-content></p></caption>
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="evoxels-code-logic.png" />
  </fig>
  <p><bold>evoxels</bold> is aimed squarely at researchers who need a
  “plug-in-your-image, get-your-answer” workflow for digital materials
  science and inverse design. Experimentalists can feed segmented
  FIB-SEM or X-ray tomograms directly into high-performance simulations;
  computational scientists and modelers benefit from a truly open,
  reproducible framework. It speaks to anyone who wants special-purpose
  solvers for representative volume elements - without the overhead of
  mesh generation - while still offering the flexibility to develop new
  solvers, test boundary conditions, and incorporate
  machine-learning-driven optimization. evoxels provides both the
  turnkey usability of a specialized package and the extensibility of a
  low-level research toolkit, e.g., benchmarking tortuosity, fitting
  diffusion coefficients, or prototyping novel phase-field models.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Understanding the link between microstructure and material
  properties is a central challenge in materials science, which
  increasingly relies on high-resolution 3D imaging, large-scale
  simulations, and data-driven optimization. Concrete examples include
  microstructure-resolved simulations on tomographic reconstructions of
  battery electrodes to quantify structure–transport relationships and
  guide electrode design
  (<xref alt="Lu et al., 2020" rid="ref-Lu2020" ref-type="bibr">Lu et
  al., 2020</xref>). Another example is the combination of operando
  imaging with physics-based inversion to infer spatially heterogeneous
  kinetics from image sequences
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2023" rid="ref-Zhao2023" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2023</xref>). A further example is phase-field post-processing
  of 3D grain-label maps from X-ray diffraction microscopy to clean up
  noisy reconstructions by filling gaps and smoothing the interfaces
  between neighboring grains
  (<xref alt="Chlupsa et al., 2024" rid="ref-Chlupsa2024" ref-type="bibr">Chlupsa
  et al., 2024</xref>). All of these workflows benefit from scalable
  voxel-based solvers that operate directly on imaging data and can be
  embedded in optimization loops. Despite the growing availability of
  segmented volumes from FIB-SEM, X-ray CT, or synchrotron tomography,
  and data augmentation through generative AI
  (<xref alt="Finegan et al., 2022" rid="ref-Finegan2022" ref-type="bibr">Finegan
  et al., 2022</xref>;
  <xref alt="Kench &amp; Cooper, 2021" rid="ref-Kench2021" ref-type="bibr">Kench
  &amp; Cooper, 2021</xref>), the pipeline from experimental data to
  simulation remains fragmented. Existing simulation tools rarely
  operate directly on voxelized microscopy data, instead requiring
  costly meshing or complex preprocessing. While boundary-conforming
  meshes (finite element/finite volume method) can better capture
  complex geometries, voxel-based methods (finite difference and Fourier
  pseudo-spectral methods) – especially in combination with smoothed
  boundary techniques
  (<xref alt="Daubner &amp; Nestler, 2024" rid="ref-Daubner2024_micro" ref-type="bibr">Daubner
  &amp; Nestler, 2024</xref>;
  <xref alt="Yu et al., 2012" rid="ref-Yu2012" ref-type="bibr">Yu et
  al., 2012</xref>) – offer a robust and practical alternative for
  computing effective material properties. In many materials science
  applications, small numerical or geometric errors (e.g., 5–10%) are
  acceptable, as modeling assumptions are often approximate and the goal
  is to capture the correct order of magnitude or understand factors
  like tortuosity or relative transport rates – that is, how much better
  or worse a given microstructure performs. Furthermore, many commercial
  codes rely on proprietary data formats, complicating data exchange and
  reproducibility. In addition to these technical hurdles, significant
  domain expertise is typically required to configure simulations, i.e.,
  choosing appropriate time-stepping schemes, numerical discretizations,
  and boundary conditions. Even for well-studied problems such as the
  Cahn–Hilliard equation
  (<xref alt="Cahn &amp; Hilliard, 1958" rid="ref-Cahn1958" ref-type="bibr">Cahn
  &amp; Hilliard, 1958</xref>;
  <xref alt="Zhu et al., 1999" rid="ref-Zhu1999" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et
  al., 1999</xref>), few user-friendly and scalable 3D Python
  implementations combine robustness, GPU acceleration, and suitability
  for large voxelized domains
  (<xref alt="Zwicker, 2020" rid="ref-Zwicker2020" ref-type="bibr">Zwicker,
  2020</xref>). Existing open-source solvers either struggle to scale
  efficiently to large 3D problems, lack GPU support, or do not support
  automatic differentiation. The broader lack of open, reusable
  simulation frameworks is even more pronounced in the field of inverse
  design and image-based parameter estimation, where many
  state-of-the-art approaches rely on bespoke, problem-specific codes
  that are not released or are difficult to reuse and extend
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2023" rid="ref-Zhao2023" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2023</xref>). These gaps in data interoperability, code
  availability, and accessible expertise continue to hinder progress in
  understanding process-structure-property relationships and limit the
  practical deployment of inverse design methodologies.</p>
  <p>The evoxels package enables large-scale forward and inverse
  simulations on uniform voxel grids, ensuring direct compatibility with
  microscopy data and harnessing GPU-optimized FFT and tensor
  operations. This design supports forward modeling of transport and
  phase evolution phenomena, as well as backpropagation-based inverse
  problems such as parameter estimation and neural surrogate training -
  tasks which are still difficult to achieve with traditional FEM-based
  solvers. This differentiable‐physics foundation enables embedding
  voxel‐based solvers as neural‐network layers, training generative
  models to optimize microstructures, and jointly optimizing processing
  and properties via gradient descent. By keeping each simulation step
  fast and fully backpropagatable, evoxels enables data‐driven materials
  discovery and high‐dimensional design‐space exploration.</p>
  <p>There remains significant untapped potential in applying FFT-based
  semi-implicit schemes
  (<xref alt="Zhu et al., 1999" rid="ref-Zhu1999" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et
  al., 1999</xref>) and exponential integrators
  (<xref alt="Hochbruck &amp; Ostermann, 2010" rid="ref-Hochbruck2010" ref-type="bibr">Hochbruck
  &amp; Ostermann, 2010</xref>) across the broader landscape of digital
  materials science. Although these methods are well-established in
  areas such as spectral homogenization and phase-field modeling, their
  adoption has largely been limited to specialized research codes. For
  example, in
  (<xref alt="Caliari et al., 2022" rid="ref-Caliari2022" ref-type="bibr">Caliari
  et al., 2022</xref>), a <monospace>C++</monospace>-CUDA implementation
  of exponential integrators combined with FFT on a GPU was shown to
  outperform state-of-the-art exponential integrator implementations by
  fully exploiting the tensor structure of the spatial discretizations.
  However, few open-source frameworks incorporate these methods into
  modern simulation pipelines that support automatic differentiation and
  GPU acceleration—capabilities increasingly critical for inverse design
  and data-driven workflows.</p>
  <p>To evaluate performance against state-of-the-art Python libraries,
  we benchmark the stiff, fourth‐order Cahn–Hilliard
  spinodal‐decomposition problem using
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://torchode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">torchode</ext-link>

  (<xref alt="Kidger, 2021" rid="ref-Kidger2021" ref-type="bibr">Kidger,
  2021</xref>). As shown in
  <xref alt="[fig:benchmark]" rid="figU003Abenchmark">[fig:benchmark]</xref>,
  evoxels’ native pseudo-spectral IMEX solver achieves runtimes one to
  two orders of magnitude shorter than general‐purpose ODE integrators
  and requires substantially less GPU memory. By contrast, the TSIT5
  integrator with PID‐controlled timestepping, available in both
  torchode and Diffrax, requires finer timesteps, increasing both
  computation time and memory use to impractical levels for parameter
  optimization or inverse‐design tasks. We also provide a custom Diffrax
  pseudo-spectral IMEX implementation fully integrated into the evoxels
  framework; although its wall time matches that of the native evoxels
  solver, it incurs higher memory overhead. Finally, fully implicit
  schemes (e.g., Diffrax’s Implicit Euler) exhaust GPU memory on
  moderate-sized 3D grids (even <inline-formula><alternatives>

  <p>The evoxels package is a lightweight, accessible, and rigorously
  tested tool for prototyping voxel-based PDE solvers, and is compared
  to domain-specific tools such as taufactor
  (<xref alt="Kench et al., 2023" rid="ref-Kench2023" ref-type="bibr">Kench

  (<xref alt="Bruckner et al., 2023" rid="ref-Bruckner2023" ref-type="bibr">Bruckner
  et al., 2023</xref>), it supports a broader range of problems,
  boundary conditions, and numerical methods while maintaining a
  modular, user-friendly interface for imaging-driven workflows.
  Compared with py-pde
  (<xref alt="Zwicker, 2020" rid="ref-Zwicker2020" ref-type="bibr">Zwicker,
  2020</xref>), evoxels places greater emphasis on image-based materials
  science applications and natively supports differentiable physics via
  automatic differentiation in PyTorch and JAX, enabling gradient-based
  inverse problems such as parameter learning and microstructure design.
  At the same time, it is more specialized and efficient for problems on
  uniform grids with fixed physics than general-purpose solvers like
  FiPy or FEniCS. evoxels is not intended to replace multiphysics
  platforms such as COMSOL or MOOSE, but to complement them by filling a
  niche in high-resolution, imaging-driven, and differentiable
  simulations.</p>
  <p>Building on prior advances in microstructure characterization
  (<xref alt="Daubner &amp; Nestler, 2024" rid="ref-Daubner2024_micro" ref-type="bibr">Daubner

  (<xref alt="Daubner et al., 2025" rid="ref-Daubner2025" ref-type="bibr">Daubner

  data
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2023" rid="ref-Zhao2023" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2023</xref>), evoxels integrates these capabilities into a
  unified, extensible codebase. It is currently used by researchers and
  students alike to advance inverse learning capabilities and develop
  advanced time-integration methods. In a field where open-source
  simulation tools remain underdeveloped, it provides a practical
  blueprint for reproducible digital materials science, helping to
  democratize capabilities that have long been confined to specialist
  groups or proprietary codebases.</p>
