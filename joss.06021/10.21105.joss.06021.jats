  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The potential for extended reality devices in medicine has recently
  grown. In order to approve these devices for medical use, they must be
  evaluated on many characteristics to ensure safety and effectiveness.
  One of the most important evaluations is the quality of the device’s
  display, known as image quality, especially for medical applications
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2023" rid="ref-ZhaoU003A2023" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2023</xref>). The image quality evaluation of virtual and
  augmented reality devices requires the creation of a variety of
  different test patterns. These test patterns consist of many different
  shapes that must frequently change their location, size, or color in
  order to adapt to the many headsets in the market
  (<xref alt="Beams et al., 2020" rid="ref-BeamsU003A2020" ref-type="bibr">Beams
  et al., 2020</xref>)
  (<xref alt="Zhao et al., 2023" rid="ref-ZhaoU003A2023" ref-type="bibr">Zhao
  et al., 2023</xref>). The Pattern Creation Tool allows for the
  creation, editing, and sharing of patterns that work in a mixed
  reality environment. The Pattern Creation Tool includes multiple
  default patterns that are commonly used in image quality evaluation.
  These include a pattern for finding the center of the device’s
  display, a pattern to measure geometric distortion, a pattern to
  measure Michelson contrast, and a pattern to measure line spread.
  These patterns can make simple testing easier as well as serve as a
  template for other patterns.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>We have developed a regulatory science tool that enables the
  measurement of head-mounted display (HMD) quality by creating
  customized scenes and patterns. This tool in particular provides an
  easy way to display scenes on multiple headsets so that users can
  assess and compare image quality. This is accomplished through the use
  of known standardized patterns like the grille or dot array and simple
  entities like circles, rectangles, or triangles. Figure 1 demonstrates
  how to edit a pattern containing multiple of these entities. This
  flexibility allows for the conduction of targeted examinations of
  specific display characteristics. For instance, users can create and
  share packages that are designed to assess display resolution,
  chromatic aberrations, color mapping, and other spatiotemporal
  effects. This tool also addresses the issue of pattern portability.
  Currently, HMDs are very heterogeneous, making it difficult to deploy
  the same pattern to multiple headsets. This barrier often comes up in
  standards meetings as an impeding force on the development and
  validation of different HMDs. In short, this tool provides scientists,
  medical device manufacturers, and regulators access to a centralized
  scene to test various display devices and provide reports that are
  easier to understand and, most importantly, replicate.</p>
  <p>The Pattern Creation Tool consists of a user interface built using
  A-Frame
  (<xref alt="AFrame, n.d." rid="ref-AFrame" ref-type="bibr">AFrame,
  n.d.</xref>), Three.js
  (<xref alt="Three.js, n.d." rid="ref-Three.js" ref-type="bibr">Three.js,
  n.d.</xref>), and WebXR
  (<xref alt="WebXR, n.d." rid="ref-WebXR" ref-type="bibr">WebXR,
  n.d.</xref>) for the easy creation of image quality test patterns. It
  is housed on a website that can be accessed on any WebXR-compatible
  device with internet access. Created test patterns and collections of
  scenes can be downloaded and shared as JSON files. This feature
  enables users to easily create and share patterns, allowing the
  testing of the same scene on multiple devices. All uploaded patterns
  remain fully editable, allowing users to make necessary changes to
  patterns that are shared with them. Additionally, test patterns can be
  saved in groups or scenes to allow for testing multiple different
  patterns or variations of a pattern. Figure 2 shows the display of a
  pattern that contains uploaded image textures.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, most extended reality development is done using
  video game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine. These game engines
  have steep learning curves, need programming skills, and are also
  heterogeneous. As a result, it can be cumbersome to generate simple
  patterns for a wide variety of devices in a timely manner. The Pattern
  Creation Tool simplifies this process by creating a user interface to
  handle pattern creation (add entities, upload textures, etc.). This
  mitigates programming experience as a limiting factor. A second issue
  present with game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine is that it can
  be difficult to run projects on different devices. This is because
  device compatibility for extended reality devices is not standardized
  yet, so different devices may or may not be compatible on different
  platforms. The Pattern Creation Tool is available on the internet, so
  any device that is compatible with WebXR will be able to access the
  tool. This includes Oculus/Meta devices and Microsoft Extended Reality
  devices. This tool utilizes WebXR and A-Frame to ensure consistent and
  reliable results across devices. Lastly, game engines are usually not
  open source, which might cause further hurdles for research. Both
  WebXR and the Pattern Creation Tool are open-source and easy to use in
  research projects. The Pattern Creation tool has been used in a
  scientific publication, where the generated patterns aided the
  creation of a new methodology for the Image Quality analysis of
  virtual reality head-mounted displays
