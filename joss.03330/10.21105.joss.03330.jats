  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Spatial optimization is a major spatial analytical tool in
  management and planning, the significance of which cannot be
  overstated. Spatial optimization models play an important role in
  designing and managing effective and efficient service systems such as
  transportation, education, public health, environmental protection,
  and commercial investment among others. To this end,
  <bold>spopt</bold> (atial imization) is under active development for
  the inclusion of newly proposed models and methods for
  regionalization, facility location, and transportation-oriented
  solutions
  (<xref alt="Feng et al., 2021" rid="ref-spopt2021" ref-type="bibr">Feng
  et al., 2021</xref>). <bold>Spopt</bold> is a submodule in the
  open-source spatial analysis library PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis
  Library) founded by Dr. Sergio J. Rey and Dr. Luc Anselin in 2005
  (<xref alt="Rey et al., 2015" rid="ref-rey2015open" ref-type="bibr">Rey
  et al., 2015</xref>,
  <xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Rey2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>;
  <xref alt="Rey &amp; Anselin, 2007" rid="ref-pysal2007" ref-type="bibr">Rey
  &amp; Anselin, 2007</xref>). The goal of developing <bold>spopt</bold>
  is to provide management and decision-making support to all relevant
  practitioners and to further promote the appropriate and meaningful
  application of spatial optimization models in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Spatial optimization methods and algorithms can be accessed in many
  ways. ArcGIS<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> and
  TransCAD<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> are two well-known
  commercial GIS software packages that provide modules designed for
  structuring and solving spatial optimization problems. The
  optimization functions they offer focus on a set classical single
  facility location methods (e.g., Weber, Median, Centroid, 1-center),
  routing and shortest path methods (e.g., shortest path on the network,
  least cost path over the terrain), and multi-facility
  location-allocation methods (e.g., coverage models, p-median problem).
  They are user-friendly and visually appealing, but the cost is
  relatively high
  (<xref alt="Murray, 2021" rid="ref-murray2021contemporary" ref-type="bibr">Murray,
  2021</xref>).</p>
  <p>Open-source software is another option to access spatial
  optimization. Although it may require users to have a certain level of
  programming experience, open-source software provides relatively novel
  and comprehensive methods, and more importantly, it is free and can be
  easily replicated. This is particularly true for regionalization and
  facility-location methods. Regionalization methods are limited in
  commercial GIS software, and may only have grouping analysis for
  vector data and region identification for raster data. On the
  contrary, there are many application-oriented open-source packages
  that facilitate the implementation of regionalization methods in
  various fields, including climate (e.g., HiClimR
  (<xref alt="Badr et al., 2015" rid="ref-badr2015tool" ref-type="bibr">Badr
  et al., 2015</xref>), synoptReg
  (<xref alt="Lemus-Canovas et al., 2019" rid="ref-LEMUSCANOVAS2019114" ref-type="bibr">Lemus-Canovas
  et al., 2019</xref>)), biology (e.g., Phyloregion
  (<xref alt="Daru et al., 2020" rid="ref-daru2020phyloregion" ref-type="bibr">Daru
  et al., 2020</xref>), regioneR
  (<xref alt="Gel et al., 2015" rid="ref-regioneR2015" ref-type="bibr">Gel
  et al., 2015</xref>)), hydrology (e.g., nsRFA
  (<xref alt="Viglione, 2009" rid="ref-nsRFA" ref-type="bibr">Viglione,
  2009</xref>)), agriculture (e.g.,
  OpenLCA<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref>), and so on. The
  functions of graph regionalization with clustering and partitioning
  have been provided by several packages in
  R<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> such as Rgeoda
  (<xref alt="Li &amp; Anselin, 2022" rid="ref-rgeoda" ref-type="bibr">Li
  &amp; Anselin, 2022</xref>), maxcut: Max-Cut Problem in sdpt3r
  (<xref alt="Rahman, 2019" rid="ref-rahman2018sdpt3r" ref-type="bibr">Rahman,
  2019</xref>), and RBGL: R Boost Graph Library
  (<xref alt="Carey et al., 2022" rid="ref-RBGL" ref-type="bibr">Carey
  et al., 2022</xref>), and grPartition within
  MATLAB<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref>. They are probably the
  most closely related projects to the regionalization functionality of
  <bold>spopt</bold>, however, they are written in R and MATLAB. For
  facility-location methods, commercial software such as ArcGIS and
  TransCAD implement models using heuristic approaches. However, they
  don’t provide details about the solution found, which limits the
  interpretability of the results
  (<xref alt="Chen et al., 2021" rid="ref-Chen2021" ref-type="bibr">Chen
  et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, existing open-source packages
  mostly aim at solving coverage problems such as pyspatialopt
  (<xref alt="Pulver, 2016" rid="ref-pyspatialopt" ref-type="bibr">Pulver,
  2016</xref>), allagash
  (<xref alt="Pulver, 2019" rid="ref-allagash" ref-type="bibr">Pulver,
  2019</xref>) and maxcovr
  (<xref alt="Tierney, 2019" rid="ref-maxcovr" ref-type="bibr">Tierney,
  2019</xref>), but the available models, solvers, and overall
  accessibility vary significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to
  develop an open-source optimization package written in Python that
  includes various types of classic facility-location methods with a
  wide range of supported optimization solvers.</p>

  <title>Current functionality</title>
  <p>Originating from the region module in PySAL, <bold>spopt</bold> is
  under active development for the inclusion of newly proposed models
  and methods for regionalization and facility location. Regarding
  regionalization, six models are developed for aggregating a large set
  of geographic units (with small footprints) into a smaller number of
  regions (with large footprints). They are:</p>
  <list list-type="order">

  <p>Take the functionality of Max-p-regions as an example. Other

  solving the model, and plotting the solution.</p>
  <code language="python">from spopt.region import MaxPHeuristic as MaxP
import geopandas, libpysal
# read in the data on regional incomes for Mexican states
mexico = geopandas.read_file(libpysal.examples.get_path(&quot;mexicojoin.shp&quot;))
# specify parameters for the Max-p-regions model
# setails can be found at https://pysal.org/spopt/notebooks/maxp.html.
attrs_name = [f&quot;PCGDP{2000}&quot;]
w = libpysal.weights.Queen.from_dataframe(mexico)
threshold_name, threshold, top_n, mexico[&quot;count&quot;] = &quot;count&quot;, 6, 2, 1
# solve the Max-p-regions model
model = MaxP(mexico, w, attrs_name, threshold_name, threshold, top_n)
model.solve()
# plot the model solution
mexico[&quot;maxp_new&quot;] = model.labels_
mexico.plot(column=&quot;maxp_new&quot;, categorical=True, edgecolor=&quot;w&quot;);</code>
  <p>The corresponding solution of Max-p-regions running the above code
  is shown in
  <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003AU0020maxp">Figure 1</xref>. It
  results in five regions, three of which have six states, and two with
  seven states each. Each region is a spatially connected component, as
  required by the Max-p-regions problem.</p>

  <p>For example, Maximal Covering Location Model functionality is used
  to select 4 out of 16 store sites in the San Francisco area to
  maximize demand coverage, as shown in
  <xref alt="Figure 2" rid="figU003AU0020mclp">Figure 2</xref>. Other
  facility-location methods can be applied in a similar way. Moreover,
  we have included functionality to place pre-determined site locations
  within the facility selection pool, allowing for realistic scenarios
  whereby 1 or more <italic>new</italic> facilities can be added to an
  <italic>existing</italic> set of locations. We believe this feature of
  intermingled new and existing facility location siting to be the first
  implementation in open-source optimization software.</p>

  <title>Planned Enhancements</title>
  <p><bold>Spopt</bold> is under active development and the developers

  near future, there are three major enhancements we plan to pursue for
  <bold>spopt</bold>:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p>The first stream will be on the enhancement of regionalization
      algorithms by including several novel extensions of the classical
      regionalization models, such as the integration of spatial data
      uncertainty and the shape of identified regions in the
      Max-p-regions problem.</p>

      <p>The second direction involves adding capacity constraints and

      <p>We anticipate adding functionality for solving traditional
      routing and transportation-oriented optimization problems.
      Initially, this will come in the form of integer programming
