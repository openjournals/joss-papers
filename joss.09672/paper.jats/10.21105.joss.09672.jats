  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Mapping transcription factor binding events and histone
  modifications on a genome-wide scale is key to understanding the
  regulatory dynamics controlling gene expression. CUT&amp;RUN,
  CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq protocols provide new avenues to map
  chromatin-associated proteins, offering advantages compared to
  ChIP-seq in terms of sensitivity, resolution and sample consumption.
  Despite differences in biochemistry, the core computational analysis
  of CUT&amp;RUN, CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq data exhibit notable
  similarities, representing an opportunity for a unified bioinformatics
  solution.</p>
  <p>Here, we present nf-core/cutandrun, a best-practice bioinformatics
  pipeline for CUT&amp;RUN, CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq data. In contrast to
  existing alternative pipelines, nf-core/cutandrun was developed based
  on the nf-core community framework to provide enhanced
  reproducibility, flexibility, scalability, portability and robustness.
  nf-core/cutandrun additionally enables the specification of spike-in
  genomes with different normalisation options, supports multiple peak
  callers, and provides extensive quality control metrics reporting. The
  pipeline supports a wide range of execution environments and operating
  systems, and is usable with minimal technical knowledge. We encourage
  user engagement with the wider nf-core community through the official
  nf-core GitHub repository and Slack channels, and aim to incorporate
  feedback in subsequent releases to ensure that the pipeline remains
  dynamic and up-to-date.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Characterising the genome-wide distribution of transcription factor
  binding events and histone modifications is key to elucidating the
  mechanics and dynamics of gene expression regulation. In recent years,
  the CUT&amp;RUN and CUT&amp;Tag protocols have emerged as alternatives
  to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), providing enhanced
  signal-to-noise ratios, as well as reduced costs and input sample
  requirements

  <xref alt="Park, 2009" rid="ref-ParkU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Park,
  2009</xref>). The CUT&amp;RUN and CUT&amp;Tag protocols first expose
  permeabilised, unfixed cells to primary antibodies, which bind a
  particular DNA-associated transcription factor or histone modification
  of interest. Secondary antibodies are added for signal amplification,
  and to facilitate the binding of either Protein A-MNase (CUT&amp;RUN)
  or Protein A-Tn5 transposase (CUT&amp;Tag) fusion constructs.
  Enzymatic activation subsequently enables local DNA cleavage to
  generate protein-associated chromatin fragments, which is followed by
  DNA extraction, library preparation, amplification and sequencing.
  Most recently, the TIP-seq protocol was additionally developed, which
  combines CUT&amp;Tag with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription to
  provide a further 10-fold increase in sensitivity
  (<xref alt="Bartlett et al., 2021" rid="ref-BartlettU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">Bartlett
  et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
  <p>Here, we present nf-core/cutandrun, a best-practice bioinformatics
  pipeline for CUT&amp;RUN, CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq datasets based on
  the original data analysis workflow by Zheng et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-ZhengU003A2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
  To meet the modern requirements for bioinformatics analysis, which we
  define to be reproducibility, flexibility, scalability, portability
  and robust reporting, we developed the pipeline in line with the
  nf-core community framework
  (<xref alt="Di Tommaso et al., 2017" rid="ref-TommasoU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Di
  Tommaso et al., 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Ewels et al., 2020" rid="ref-EwelsU003A2020" ref-type="bibr">Ewels
  et al., 2020</xref>). nf-core/cutandrun provides several advantages
  relative to CUT&amp;RUNTools and ePeak, which are the only current
  alternative pipelines for the end-to-end analysis of CUT&amp;RUN and
  CUT&amp;Tag data
  (<xref alt="Daunesse et al., 2022" rid="ref-DaunesseU003A2022" ref-type="bibr">Daunesse
  et al., 2022</xref>;
  <xref alt="Yu et al., 2022" rid="ref-YuU003A2022" ref-type="bibr">Yu

  <xref alt="Zhu et al., 2019" rid="ref-ZhuU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Zhu
  et al., 2019</xref>). First, as a result of the protein production
  process in original CUT&amp;RUN and CUT&amp;Tag protocols, there is
  residual <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA that can be used as a natural
  spike-in calibrator. This <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA is increasingly
  purified out of commercial kits, with spike-in DNA being manually
  added during the protocol. Manual addition of spike-in DNA can
  introduce considerable experimental error, leading to low alignment
  rates that are insufficient for normalisation. Consequently, we
  included additional read count-based normalisation modes and support
  for user-defined spike-in genomes. The pipeline additionally provides
  three distinct peak calling methods, including SEACR, MACS2 narrow,
  and MACS2 broad peak modes. We selected SEACR as the default peak
  caller, as it has been demonstrated to provide greater specificity and
  efficiency of peak calling on sparse data
  (<xref alt="Meers et al., 2019" rid="ref-MeersU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Meers
  et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, nf-core/cutandrun provides extensive
  quality control (QC) metrics reporting to maximise confidence prior to
  downstream analysis, and uniquely supports the analysis of TIP-seq
  data.</p>

  <title>Workflow overview</title>
  <p>nf-core/cutandrun offers a robust data analysis workflow that is
  designed for Illumina-based sequencing data obtained from CUT&amp;RUN,
  CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq experiments (Figure 1).</p>

  <p>The workflow initialises by performing checks on input files and
  determining the experimental design in terms of sample grouping,
  potential IgG controls, and the required normalisation mode. During
  pre-processing, the raw FASTQ files are merged, considering multi-lane
  sequencing or technical replicates as defined in the sample sheet. The
  resultant, merged FASTQ files are initially screened using FastQC to
  collect QC metrics, before undergoing trimming by TrimGalore to remove
  sequencing adaptors from reads
  (<xref alt="Andrews, 2010" rid="ref-AndrewsU003A2010" ref-type="bibr">Andrews,

  <xref alt="Krueger, 2012" rid="ref-KruegerU003A2012" ref-type="bibr">Krueger,
  2012</xref>). FastQC is re-executed post-trimming, consistent with the
  workflow’s emphasis on transparency and interpretability. The reads
  are next aligned to both the target reference genome and the spike-in
  genome using Bowtie2
  (<xref alt="Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012" rid="ref-LangmeadU003A2012" ref-type="bibr">Langmead
  &amp; Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Alignment statistics, fragment
  distributions and binned sample correlation metrics are calculated for
  each sample using SAMtools, deepTools, and custom Python scripts,
  aiding users in identifying potential issues with the alignment
  process

  <xref alt="Ramírez et al., 2016" rid="ref-RamirezU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Ramírez
  et al., 2016</xref>). Reads which aligned to the target genome are
  subjected to q-score filtering using SAMtools, and deduplication using
  Picard (IgG controls only by default)
  (<xref alt="Broad Institute, 2019" rid="ref-PicardU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Broad

  <xref alt="Li et al., 2009" rid="ref-LiU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Li
  et al., 2009</xref>). For TIP-seq data, linear amplification
  duplicates are additionally removed with custom Python scripts.
  Scaling factors for BAM-to-BedGraph conversion are calculated per
  sample, based on the number of reads that aligned to the spike-in
  genome. BedGraph files are also converted to a BigWig format to
  auto-generate IGV sessions, and generate heatmaps using deepTools
  (<xref alt="Ramírez et al., 2016" rid="ref-RamirezU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Ramírez

  <xref alt="Robinson et al., 2011" rid="ref-RobinsonU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Robinson
  et al., 2011</xref>). By default, peak calling is performed using
  SEACR, which was specifically developed for protocols with low
  background noise
  (<xref alt="Meers et al., 2019" rid="ref-MeersU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Meers
  et al., 2019</xref>). However, the pipeline also supports peak calling
  using MACS2 either instead of or in addition to SEACR. At this stage,
  any IgG controls are split out and used to normalise peak calling
  against background levels of non-specific antibody binding. Peaks are
  merged into consensus peak sets based on sample groupings, and
  intra-group peak reproducibility is assessed using both the number of
  reproducible peaks and FRiP scores (Fraction of Reads in Peaks).
  Finally, comprehensive summaries of the workflow execution, parameter
  settings, software versions, and QC metrics are aggregated into a
  single MultiQC report

  Docker (see for a review
  <xref alt="Rad et al., 2017" rid="ref-RadU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Rad

  (<xref alt="Kurtzer et al., 2017" rid="ref-KurtzerU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Kurtzer
  et al., 2017</xref>). The workflow is automatically downloaded by
  Nextflow when the keywords ‘nf-core/cutandrun’ are included within a
  run statement, rendering manual installation unnecessary. Pipeline
  installation and operation are easily verified by running pre-defined
  test routines with public data hosted in the cloud, allowing users to
  stress test the host system before data analysis. nf-core/cutandrun
  supports a wide range of execution environments including local,
  cluster and cloud instances that run on macOS, Linux or Windows
  operating systems. A rich set of parameters supports workflow
  customisation and flow-switching, and all results are provided in a
  single, intuitively-structured folder to facilitate troubleshooting.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Here we have presented nf-core/cutandrun, a best-practice
  bioinformatics pipeline for the end-to-end analysis of CUT&amp;RUN,
  CUT&amp;Tag and TIP-seq data. By adhering to nf-core community
  guidelines, the pipeline fulfils our defined prerequisites for modern
  bioinformatics analysis, and supports a range of execution platforms,
  operating systems, and resource-limited scenarios. Our pipeline
  supports user-defined spike-in genomes, offers additional read
  count-based normalisation modes, supports three distinct peak calling
  methods, and uniquely facilitates TIP-seq data analysis. We provide
  additional command line parameters for workflow customisation,
  including the specification of technical replicates, flow-switching
  options, and pipeline execution reporting. Collectively, we conclude
  that these properties of nf-core/cutandrun provide significant
  advantages relative to current alternative pipelines. Readers are
  encouraged to engage with the nf-core community through the official
  nf-core GitHub repository and Slack channels.</p>
