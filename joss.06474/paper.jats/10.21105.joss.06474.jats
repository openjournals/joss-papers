  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>With the advent of gene editing playing a regular role in producing
  new experimental models, the need to get the appropriate allele at
  each respective locus in a model organism is now common. Instead of
  simple “knockout” vs “wildtype” mouse experiments, for example, it is
  common for there to be a gene of interest that is either floxed
  (surrounded by known genetic sequence that allow for a gene to be
  knocked out when coexpression of the cre protein is expressed) or not
  floxed depending on the experimental group, another gene that marks
  cells of a certain phenotype such as a fluorescent reporter, a cre
  expression cassette to flox the gene of interest out, and more. While
  it is often obvious how to efficiently breed experimental organisms to
  obtain one locus of interest, once three or more loci are involved
  this becomes difficult to assess. MousebreedeR is a free and open
  source web-based shiny app and command line R package that takes
  desired mouse genotypes as well as the genotypes of potential mouse
  breeders that the user already has on hand as inputs, and delivers
  efficient breeding schema as the output. In addition, it supplies the
  user with the probability of producing each potential pup, the
  probability that no pups with the desired genotype are born in a
  litter, and more. We have also supplied code that assists the user in
  plotting these tables to help them visualize crosses of interest and
  make decisions in their breeding.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Efficient breeding is a scientific imperative: with a limited
  period of fertility in experimental organisms, users may only have
  limited attempts with organisms of desired genotypes
  (<xref alt="Handelsman et al., 2020" rid="ref-RN204" ref-type="bibr">Handelsman
  et al., 2020</xref>;
  <xref alt="Murray et al., 2010" rid="ref-RN203" ref-type="bibr">Murray
  et al., 2010</xref>). Taking into account both gestational time and
  the necessary time it takes to wean pups off their mother’s milk, an
  inefficient cross can set the user back months in the case of a female
  pregnant with the non-optimal male’s offspring. Furthermore, as most
  research centers pay <italic>per diem</italic> costs, inefficiency is
  a large direct cost for many experimentalists. Individual cages often
  cost hundreds of dollars per year just in maintenance fees, not even
  accounting for the cost of extra rounds of genotyping (requiring PCR
  primers, PCR mastermix, gels, dye, etc) or for the time dedicated to
  the project by employees. Most importantly, ethical and animal welfare
  concerns also arise as inefficient breeding results in the mass
  euthanasia of non-desired animals as well as ear/tail-clipping
  required for genotyping, which may cause animals pain and
  distress.</p>
  <p>While the breeding schema to obtain a litter of full knockout mice
  from one wildtype/wildtype parent and one knockout/knockout parent is
  straightforward, this is not the case for the situation where one has
  4 alleles at 4 loci in 4 separate mice, which all need to co-occur in
  the same mouse for a given planned experiment, for example.
  Furthermore, to our knowledge, no current software exists that can
  quantitatively assist the user in creating their breeding schema.
  Indeed, if there are 2 alleles at each locus, when attempting to make
  a genetically marked, inducible, cre-lox model with T cell specificity
  as our lab was doing and which prompted us to create this software, 81
  possible combinations exist (3 (AA, Aa, and aa) to the 4th power).
  With 81 possible males and 81 possible females to mate, 6561 possible
  pairings exist (81 * 81). Use of the mousebreedeR software to optimize
  that breeding schema has been most helpful.</p>
