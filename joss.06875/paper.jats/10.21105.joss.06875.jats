  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) approach
  (<xref alt="Nigel Saunders &amp; Miodownik, 1998" rid="ref-CALPHADU003A1998" ref-type="bibr">Nigel
  Saunders &amp; Miodownik, 1998</xref>) provides predictions for
  thermodynamically stable phases in multicomponent-multiphase materials
  across a wide range of temperatures. Consequently, the CALPHAD
  calculations became an essential tool in materials and process design
  (<xref alt="Luo, 2015" rid="ref-LuoU003A2015" ref-type="bibr">Luo,
  2015</xref>). Such design tasks frequently require navigating a
  high-dimensional space due to multiple components involved in the
  system. This increasing complexity demands high-throughput CALPHAD
  calculations, especially in the rapidly evolving field of alloy
  design.</p>
  <p>In response to the need, we developed Equilipy an open-source
  Python package designed for calculating phase equilibria of
  multicomponent-multiphase systems. Equilipy is specifically tailored
  for high-throughput CALPHAD calculations, offering parallel
  computations across multiple processors and nodes with the given
  <italic>NPT</italic> input conditions namely elemental compositions
  (<italic>N</italic>), pressure (<italic>P</italic>), and temperature
  (<italic>T</italic>). Equilipy utilizes the program structure and
  Gibbs energy functions from the Fortran-based program, Thermochimica
  (<xref alt="Piro et al., 2013" rid="ref-ThermochimicaU003A2013" ref-type="bibr">Piro
  et al., 2013</xref>), with incorporating a new Gibbs energy
  minimization algorithm. This algorithm, originally developed by
  Capitani and Brown in 1987
  (<xref alt="Capitani &amp; Brown, 1987" rid="ref-CapitaniU003A1987" ref-type="bibr">Capitani
  &amp; Brown, 1987</xref>), has been revised and implemented to enhance
  the stability and performance of calculations. The Fortran codes are
  precompiled and interfaced with Python via
  <monospace>F2PY</monospace>, ensuring high computation speed.
  Benchmark tests shown in <xref alt="[Fig1]" rid="Fig1">[Fig1]</xref>
  demonstrate that Equilipy’s computation speed is comparable to those
  of established commercial software, TC-Python and PanPython. This
  result highlights its efficiency and potential applications in various
  scientific and industrial fields.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>Commercial thermochemical software packages such as Thermo-Calc
  (<xref alt="Andersson et al., 2002" rid="ref-ThermoCalcU003A2002" ref-type="bibr">Andersson
  et al., 2002</xref>), FactSage
  (<xref alt="Bale et al., 2016" rid="ref-FactSageU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Bale
  et al., 2016</xref>), and Pandat
  (<xref alt="Cao et al., 2009" rid="ref-PandatU003A2009" ref-type="bibr">Cao
  et al., 2009</xref>) are the standard for phase equilibrium
  calculations. However, exploring a broad spectrum of alloy chemistries
  is often hindered by the considerable computational time required.
  Such computational demands create a bottleneck in effective alloy
  design processes. While efforts to leverage high-performance computing
  (HPC) have been initiated to expedite computational speed, these
  attempts are often limited by licensing constraints such as the number
  of processors available for use (e.g., TC-Python permits only up to 32
  logical processors per each license).</p>
  <p>Given these limitations and the pressing need for more effective
  alloy design processes, developing an open-source program tailored for
  high-throughput CALPHAD calculations becomes imperative. The
  envisioned program should not only eliminate the constraints on
  processor usage, but also ensure high calculation stability.
  Furthermore, the program should operate on Linux systems and support
  parallel computing to be compatible with HPC environments. An
  intuitive program architecture is preferred to enhance accessibility
  for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p>

  <title>Software overview</title>
  <p>Equilipy is designed to compute thermodynamically stable phases
  from a specified <italic>NPT</italic> ensemble (i.e.,
  <italic>N</italic>: elemental composition, <italic>P</italic>:
  pressure, <italic>T</italic>: temperature). The four-step process for
  calculating phase equilibria is illustrated in
  <xref alt="[Fig2]" rid="Fig2">[Fig2]</xref>. This process closely
  mirrors experimental procedures; thus, it is highly intuitive even for
  the users primarily experienced in experimental work. Calculating
  phase equilibria involves minimizing a set of Gibbs energy functions
  for all relevant phases. Therefore, utilizing Equilipy necessitates a
  Gibbs energy database developed through the CALPHAD approach.</p>

  <p>By default, phase equilibrium calculations consider all available
  phases within the given thermochemical database, corresponding to the
  input system elements. Consequently, we obtain thermodynamically
  stable phases, their respective quantities through equilibrium
  calculations, alongside pertinent thermochemical properties such as
  Gibbs energy (<italic>G</italic>), enthalpy (<italic>H</italic>),
  entropy (<italic>S</italic>), and heat capacity (<italic>Cp</italic>).
  The demonstration of such calculations is given in <bold>Phase
  equilibria</bold> section for multiphase equilibria. Moreover, we
  introduce the application of thermodynamic calculations for
  solidifications
  (<xref alt="Scheil, 1942" rid="ref-ScheilU003A1942" ref-type="bibr">Scheil,
  1942</xref>) in <bold>Scheil-Gulliver solidification</bold>.
  Metastable phase stability calculations are possible with the phase
  selection option, as detailed in the step 2 of
  <xref alt="[Fig2]" rid="Fig2">[Fig2]</xref>. This option enables the
  parsing of custom-selected phases within the relevant phase set for
  metastable calculations. Examples showcasing the phase selection

    <p><xref alt="[Fig3]" rid="Fig3">[Fig3]</xref> presents the phase
    equilibrium calculations of the Al-Cu-Mg-Si system. We conducted
    Gibbs energy minimization of 63 distinct phases to derive the stable
    phase assemblages and their respective quantities at each
    calculation point. These calculations were performed using
    <monospace>equilib_batch()</monospace> feature. The outcomes were
    then compared with results from a commercial thermochemical
    software, FactSage
    (<xref alt="Bale et al., 2016" rid="ref-FactSageU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Bale

    respectively. The comparative analyses reveal that both programs
    consistently predicted the same stable phases and their quantities.
    It is worth noting that the <monospace>equilib_batch()</monospace>

    <title>Scheil-Gulliver solidification</title>
    <p>Exploring Scheil-Gulliver solidification offers a robust
    framework for assessing the performance of phase equilibria
    calculations. In Scheil-Gulliver solidification, the liquid phase is
    assumed to remain completely mixed, while no diffusion or reaction
    is considered between solid phases once they precipitate from the
    liquid. This approach effectively represents the characteristics of
    rapid and slow diffusion in the liquid and solid phases during
    solidification, respectively. A single Scheil-Gulliver cooling
    computation necessitates multiple equilibrium calculation
    iterations, i.e., one for each temperature step. This approach
    serves as a rigorous benchmark to assess the accuracy and stability
    of Equilipy in comparison with the well-established commercial
    software, FactSage
    (<xref alt="Bale et al., 2016" rid="ref-FactSageU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Bale
    et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p><xref alt="[Fig5]" rid="Fig5">[Fig5]</xref> demonstrates the
    progression of microstructural information and phase quantities
    during Scheil-Gulliver solidification. The microstructural
    information is presented in
    <xref alt="[Fig5]" rid="Fig5">[Fig5]</xref>(a), where each color
    represents a unique set of solidifying phases, termed a Scheil
    constituent
    (<xref alt="Pelton et al., 2017" rid="ref-PeltonU003A2017" ref-type="bibr">Pelton
    et al., 2017</xref>). Initially, the FCC_A1 solid phase forms at 861
    K and continues to solidify as a primary phase until it reaches a
    fraction of 20 mol%. Following this, the next Scheil constituent is
    a two-phase eutectic structure comprised of FCC_A1 and DIAMOND_A4
    phases. This eutectic structure persists in solidifying until the
    temperature reduces to 793 K. At this juncture of solidification,
    over 90 mol% of the liquid has been consumed, followed by the
    formation of less than 10 mol% of complex three- and four-phase
    eutectic structures. <xref alt="[Fig5]" rid="Fig5">[Fig5]</xref>(b)
    shows the respective quantity of each phase during Scheil-Gulliver
    solidification. Various rates of solidifying amount for a phase
    (e.g., FCC_A1) highlights that a phase can be involved in multiple
    Scheil constituents. As depicted in the figure, the fractions of
    Scheil constituents and respective phase quantities align closely
    with those calculated by FactSage, demonstrating the reliability and
    accuracy of the simulation results.</p>

    calculations and (b) Scheil-Gulliver solidification. For each case,
    a set of custom-selected phases was applied as outlined in step 2 of
    <xref alt="[Fig2]" rid="Fig2">[Fig2]</xref>. The equilibrium
    calculations shown in <xref alt="[Fig6]" rid="Fig6">[Fig6]</xref>(a)

  <title>Parallel computing</title>
  <p>Equilipy leverages parallel computing to calculate multiple input
  conditions simultaneously through its
  <monospace>equilib_batch()</monospace> function. Since computations
  between input conditions are fully independent, they are executed
  through embarrassingly parallel runs. Note that parallel computing is
  not applied to compute a single input condition. By default, Equilipy
  uses all available processors on a single computing node, though users
  have the option to specify a different number of processors. In
  multi-node environments, users are required to configure the number of
  nodes and processors using a Message Passing Interface (MPI) such as
  <monospace>OpenMPI</monospace> or <monospace>MPICH</monospace>.
  Equilipy employs <monospace>mpi4py</monospace> for interfacing with
  MPI programs.</p>

  <p>For geological applications, the Gibbs energies of non-ideal
  solution phases are described by Margules parameters as a function of
  composition, pressure, and temperature. In contrast, the CALPHAD
  approach focuses on structure-based Gibbs energy descriptions at 1 atm
  pressure using solution models such as the compound energy formalism
  (CEF) for long-range ordering and the modified quasichemical models
  for short-range ordering. These variations in free energy descriptions
  are well-documented in the literature for the CALPHAD approach

  <p>Note that there is no general consensus on a thermochemical
  database format. Each software often has its own format. The database
  format used in Equilipy (<monospace>.dat</monospace>) is compatible in
  FactSage

  <title>Limitation and future plan</title>
  <p>The current version of Equilipy (0.1.5) is specifically designed
  for metallic systems and currently lacks the capability to handle
  calculations for systems composed of non-elemental species, such as
  oxides, sulfides, carbides, nitrides, etc. Integration of these
  calculations with non-elemental species is planned for the upcoming
  version. Additionally, the existing thermochemical database parser in
  Equilipy is compatible only with the older ChemSage data format
  <monospace>.dat</monospace>, available from FactSage 7.3. It’s
  important to note that Equilipy does not support the newer ChemSage
  <monospace>.dat</monospace> data format introduced in FactSage 8.0 or
  later, nor the <monospace>.tdb</monospace> data format used by
  Thermo-Calc and Pandat. Enhancements to incorporate parsers for these
  newer database structures are also planned for the next release of
  Equilipy.</p>
