  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>The Raster Tools Python package provides an application programmers
  interface (API) for building raster data processing pipelines.
  Pipelines built with Raster Tools can efficiently process extremely
  large raster datasets, including those larger than the system’s
  available memory. Raster Tools can be deployed on systems ranging from
  small laptops to high performance computing environments. To aid in
  the construction of raster processing pipelines, Raster Tools provides
  a consistent API to a suite of scalable and lazy raster processing
  functions including focal, zonal, clipping, convolution, and distance
  analysis operations. Raster Tools makes it much easier and more
  accessible to perform research using today’s massive raster
  datasets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>Python has become very popular as a language for data processing.
  This is because it provides a rich, general purpose, data stack, and
  simple, easy to understand syntax. Because of this, it is a good
  choice for tackling the expanding data problem. Some key libraries in
  the stack are Numpy
  (<xref alt="Harris et al., 2020" rid="ref-numpy" ref-type="bibr">Harris
  et al., 2020</xref>), Xarray
  (<xref alt="Hoyer &amp; Hamman, 2017" rid="ref-xarray" ref-type="bibr">Hoyer
  &amp; Hamman, 2017</xref>), SciPy
  (<xref alt="Virtanen et al., 2020" rid="ref-scipy" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen
  et al., 2020</xref>), and Dask
  (<xref alt="Dask Development Team, 2016" rid="ref-dask" ref-type="bibr">Dask
  Development Team, 2016</xref>). Numpy forms the foundation of Python’s
  stack by providing a fast and powerful N-dimensional (ND) array
  implementation and API for manipulating them. The Xarray package
  builds on this by supplying an API for working with labelled ND
  datasets. This is especially relevant to raster data with labeled
  dimensions and coordinates. Its data structures can be backed by any
  array object that implements Numpy’s array interface, with Numpy being
  the default. The SciPy package provides optimized implementations of a
  wide variety of scientific and engineering algorithms.</p>
  <p>The Python data stack also includes packages for working with
  geospatial data. The two main packages are both Python bindings for
  GDAL
  (<xref alt="GDAL/OGR contributors, 2024" rid="ref-gdal" ref-type="bibr">GDAL/OGR
  contributors, 2024</xref>). The first is the GDAL project’s package of
  the same name. This package is a thin wrapper around the C/C++ library
  and can be cumbersome and difficult to use. The second is Rasterio
  (<xref alt="Gillies &amp; others, 2013--" rid="ref-rasterio" ref-type="bibr">Gillies
  &amp; others, 2013--</xref>), which provides a more modern and
  “Pythonic” API for working with geospatial data, but does not
  implement many of GDAL’s features. A third package, rioxarray
  (<xref alt="rioxarray Development Team, 2019" rid="ref-rioxarray" ref-type="bibr">rioxarray
  Development Team, 2019</xref>), is a plugin for Xarray that allows
  raster formats to be easily read into Xarray’s data structures and for
  those data structures to use Rasterio operations on the underlying
  data. Finally, odc-geo
  (<xref alt="OpenDataCube, 2025" rid="ref-odcgeo" ref-type="bibr">OpenDataCube,
  2025</xref>) provides several geospatial tools and algorithms such as
  grid definitions and reprojection. It also can function as a plugin
  for Xarray.</p>
  <p>Together, these packages and the wider Python data stack can be
  leveraged to carry out simple and advanced raster processing and
  geographic information systems (GIS) work. There are some limitations,
  however. Several merit consideration. First, in the GIS world, null or
  missing data is typically handled with sentinel values that are
  outside of the data domain (e.g. -9999), while in much of Python’s
  data stack, this is handled with NaN values. These two paradigms can
  be difficult to reconcile, and it requires boilerplate code to
  properly mask data. Second, Numpy does not support parallel processing
  without writing C extensions, which is difficult at best. Newer
  packages such as Numba
  (<xref alt="Lam et al., 2015" rid="ref-numba" ref-type="bibr">Lam et
  al., 2015</xref>) and Numexpr
  (<xref alt="McLeod, 2018" rid="ref-numexpr" ref-type="bibr">McLeod,
  2018</xref>) can help with this, but their scope is still limited.
  They also require more boilerplate code to be written. Third, if the
  size of the target dataset approaches or exceeds the available memory,
  Numpy and everything built on it will exhaust the available memory and
  fail. This is because Numpy and most of the Python data stack is
  “in-core.” All the data is in memory when processing occurs. To tackle
  this problem, more boilerplate code must be written to manually chunk
  the data and process it in batches.</p>
  <p>The last two issues can be solved by using the Dask package. Dask
  provides a relatively simple interface for parallel computing in
  Python. It allows large arrays to be chunked into smaller pieces and
  processed in parallel using its schedulers. This allows for
  out-of-core (OOC) or external memory processing of datasets, where
  only part of the dataset is loaded into memory at any given time. Dask
  implements much of Numpy’s API and can therefore be used to replace
  Numpy arrays in data pipelines, with some boilerplate applied. Xarray
  and odc-geo have first class support for Dask, while rioxarray has
  partial support for it.</p>
  <p>With the packages described above, it is possible to perform both
  simple and advanced data and GIS processing on large datasets. It can
  be time consuming and difficult, however, to implement. Boilerplate
  code is needed to cover compatibility gaps, such as making Rasterio
  and SciPy functions compatible with Dask. Code is also needed to
  properly handle missing data and to implement common and advanced GIS
  operations. There is no package that does all of this for the
  user.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="current-state-of-the-field">
  <title>Current State of the Field</title>
  <p>Several open-source Python packages try to address these needs in
  the Python ecosystem, but each does so differently and has its own
  limitations. Some examples are WhteboxTools
  (<xref alt="J. Lindsay, 2018" rid="ref-wbtman" ref-type="bibr">J.
  Lindsay, 2018</xref>;
  <xref alt="J. B. Lindsay, 2016" rid="ref-wbtgat" ref-type="bibr">J. B.
  Lindsay, 2016</xref>), GeoUtils
  (<xref alt="G. developers, 2020--2026" rid="ref-geoutils" ref-type="bibr">G.
  developers, 2020--2026</xref>), and Xarray-Spatial
  (<xref alt="X.-S. developers, 2020--2026" rid="ref-xrspatial" ref-type="bibr">X.-S.
  developers, 2020--2026</xref>).</p>
  <p>WhiteboxTools is a geospatial library providing hundreds of raster
  and GIS analysis functions through Python bindings. It is compiled and
  highly performant and capable of processing raster data in parallel.
  However, it presents several limitations: it lacks integration with
  the Python data stack and requires data to be fully loaded into memory
  for processing. Additionally, operations cannot be chained in memory;
  each tool must read from storage, process the data, and write the
  output back to storage before the next step can begin. A newer
  adaptation, Whitebox Workflows for Python, has been released, which
  allows chaining. It is proprietary freeware with a paid upgrade
  package, however.</p>
  <p>Built on top of Rasterio, GeoUtils is a package designed for
  efficient geospatial analysis with Python operator overloading and
  NumPy integration. It leverages Python’s multiprocessing module to
  process rasters in parallel. However, the package has notable
  limitations: most operations are eager and load the full dataset into
  memory, and it only implements a few geospatial operations such as
  reproject and proximity. Additionally, GeoUtils currently lacks
  compatibility with Dask and offers limited integration with Xarray.
  Work is ongoing to add Dask support, and an Xarray extension is
  planned. xDEM is a package from the same authors, built on top of
  GeoUtils, which provides a suite of digital elevation model (DEM)
  focused functions.</p>
  <p>Finally, Xarray-Spatial is a package designed for spatial analysis
  of rasters, built directly on Xarray data objects. It provides a wide
  variety of analysis functions and features acceleration via Numba and
  scalability through Dask support. Additionally, the library offers GPU
  capabilities by leveraging CuPy
  (<xref alt="Okuta et al., 2017" rid="ref-cupy" ref-type="bibr">Okuta
  et al., 2017</xref>) and Numba’s just-in-time (JIT) cuda compilation.
  However, the package has some limitations, including an inflexible
  and, sometimes, inconsistent interface where support for Dask, GPU
  acceleration, and parallel processing varies across different
  functions. Data type support is also restricted, with most functions
  converting inputs to float 32 and using NaNs for missing data, and the
  library currently lacks some common raster operations found in other
  tools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="software-description">
  <title>Software Description</title>
  <p>We introduce the Raster Tools package as a solution to the above
  problems and as a tool to build pipelines for processing of both large
  and small-scale raster datasets. Raster Tools seeks to bridge the gaps
  in the Python data stack by taking care of the necessary boilerplate.
  It also provides a platform for carrying out GIS processing and
  analysis by implementing a suite of common and advanced GIS operations
  that are OOC compatible. These operations would normally be pulled
  from several other packages, implemented from scratch, or some
  combination of the two. By taking care of these tasks, Raster Tools
  enables researchers to tackle large problems and datasets whose size
  may have been prohibitive before.</p>
  <p>At the core of Raster Tools is the Raster class. This class
  provides several useful features that help with raster processing such
  as operator overloading, Numpy universal function (Ufunc) and
  aggregation compatibility, and the ability to open or save to any GDAL
  supported format. With operator overloading, Raster objects behave
  much like Numpy arrays and can be used with any of Python’s
  arithmetic, logical, bitwise, and comparison operators. By
  implementing Numpy’s Ufunc interface, Raster objects provide
  compatibility with Numpy’s element-wise functions such as sin, cos,
  sqrt, exp, etc. The result of calling a Numpy Ufunc on a Raster object
  will always be another Raster object. These two features, together,
  make implementing mathematical models as easy as writing the equations
  as expressions in code. All these operations are missing-data aware.
  The Raster class implements a lazy evaluation model inherited from
  Dask. Computational graphs are constructed during operation chaining,
  deferring data loading and processing until an explicit trigger, such
  as saving to disk or explicit loading, is executed. This enables the
  definition of complex pipelines that exceed local memory limits. The
  code listing below shows an example of an index being calculated from
  Landsat 8 bands and saved to disk.</p>
  <code language="python">import numpy as np
import raster_tools as rts

# Create two Raster objects pointing to the red and near-IR bands
red = rts.Raster(&quot;data/landsat_stack.tif&quot;).get_bands(4)
nir = rts.Raster(&quot;data/landsat_stack.tif&quot;).get_bands(5)
# Calculate the MSAVI2 index. This is lazy and no computation has occurred.
msavi2 = (2 * (nir + 1) - np.sqrt((2 * nir + 1) ** 2 - 8 * (nir - red))) / 2
# Save to storage. This starts computation.
msavi2.save( &quot;outputs/msavi2.tif&quot;, tiled=True, bigtiff=&quot;IF_NEEDED&quot;, compress=&quot;LZW&quot; )</code>
  <p>In conjunction with the Raster class, Raster Tools provides an API
  for raster processing. This API consists of the following modules:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>clipping:</monospace> functions for clipping rasters
      using vector geometries.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>creation:</monospace> functions for creating rasters
      based off a reference grid with analogs to Numpy’s ones_like,
      zeros_like, etc, as well as for generating data from random
      distributions.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>distance:</monospace> functions for computing
      proximity and cost-distance analysis.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>focal:</monospace> functions for applying focal
      operations,including convolution, to rasters.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>general:</monospace> general purpose functions such
      as raster value remapping.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>line_stats:</monospace> advanced function for
      calculating statistics on line-vectors overlayed on a raster.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>rasterize:</monospace> functions for rasterizing
      vector geometries.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>surface:</monospace> functions for transforming
      DEMs, such as aspect, slope, and 3D surface area.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>vector:</monospace> functions for handling vector
      data.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>warp:</monospace> functions for reprojecting
      rasters.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><monospace>zonal:</monospace> functions for computing zonal
      statistics.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>All parts of the API are lazy and parallel with one exception. The
  cost-distance analysis functions are fully in memory and non-parallel
  due to the difficulty in parallelizing the algorithm. The results
  returned by the cost-distance analysis functions are Raster objects
  and thus still compatible with the rest of the API. With the suite of
  operations provided in the API, it is possible to carry out a wide
  range of raster analysis and processing tasks.</p>
  <p>Because the API is lazy, it is possible to chain many operations
  together before saving results back to disk. This can prevent the need
  to write an intermediate product after each operation and greatly
  reduce read/write overhead in processing pipelines as well as storage
  needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="compatibility">
  <title>Compatibility</title>
  <p>Raster Tools offers a high degree of compatibility with the wider
  Python data stack. The Raster class has methods and attributes for
  converting raster objects into Numpy and Dask arrays, Xarray DataArray
  and Dataset objects, and dask-geopandas GeoDataFrame vectors
  (<xref alt="Bossche et al., 2025" rid="ref-dask_geopandas" ref-type="bibr">Bossche
  et al., 2025</xref>). This compatibility works in the opposite
  direction as well. The Raster Tools classes and functions can ingest
  Numpy and Dask arrays and Xarray objects. This extends to the
  overloaded operators. It is possible to multiply a Numpy array against
  a Raster object with matching spatial dimensions and get a new Raster
  with the expected result. Because of Raster Tools’ compatibility, it
  is possible to easily convert data to an appropriate format for
  another library and then ingest results back into Raster Tools, or
  vice versa.</p>
  <p>Raster Tools also provides the Model Predict API. This API allows a
  model to be applied to any raster in a lazy fashion, compatible with
  the rest of the package. Using the Model Predict API allows models not
  normally compatible with Dask or Raster Tools to be easily folded into
  pipelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="scaling">
  <title>Scaling</title>
  <p>To evaluate the performance and scaling of Raster Tools, we
  benchmarked it in a controlled computing environment. The environment
  used was a virtual machine with 400 GiB of memory and a variable
  number of CPU cores. We created several scenarios for benchmarking. To
  test scaling, we set the CPU count at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 and ran all
  the scenarios for each count. The scenarios are described in the table
  below. The input rasters for the scenarios, labeled A, B, and C below,
  were copies of the same 30m digital elevation model (DEM) of the
  continental US (CONUS). These were single precision (float 32) rasters
  and roughly 60 GB uncompressed on disk. The timing for the scenarios
  was done using Python’s <monospace>time</monospace> module and
  includes both loading of the input rasters and writing of the result
  rasters. A chunk size of 256 MiB was used. Testing was performed in
  Q3-Q4 2025. At the time, Raster Tools was only compatible with Dask’s
  default scheduler, so that was the Dask scheduler used. The results
  shown here should be taken as a baseline, since the new scheduler is
  expected to improve performance.</p>

  <title>Use in Research</title>
  <p>Raster Tools has been used in several research projects. It was
  used in Johnson et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-johnson2022" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
  to process 35 years of Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire
  severity raster data for all of Montana into a tabular format for
  model training. It was used in Lahrichi et al.
  (<xref alt="2025" rid="ref-lahrichi2025" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>)
  to process burn mask rasters for use in training fire spread
  prediction models. Raster tools was also used to process rasters,
  rasterize vectors, and complete a wide range of geospatial analysis in
  Wiard
  (<xref alt="2025" rid="ref-wiard2025" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>) and
  Wiard-Greene et al.
  (<xref alt="2026" rid="ref-wiard2026" ref-type="bibr">2026</xref>).</p>
  <p>Raster Tools is also being used in production by the Forest Service
  for their Potential Control Locations (PCL) product
  (<xref alt="Connor et al., 2017" rid="ref-connor2017" ref-type="bibr">Connor

  (<xref alt="O’Connor et al., 2022" rid="ref-conner2022" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor
  et al., 2022</xref>). When initially created, the PCL product was a
  static, yearly raster for the western half of the United States at 30m
  resolution. The pipeline for producing PCL was large and time
  intensive. In 2023 and 2024, the pipeline was completely rebuilt using
  Raster Tools for its raster processing. The current PCL product is now
  dynamic and can be produced hourly for local fire support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="limitations">
  <title>Limitations</title>
  <p>Raster Tools has limitations which we acknowledge here. During the
  benchmarking period (Q3–Q4 2025), Raster Tools was constrained to
  Dask’s default threaded scheduler due to a dependency being
  incompatible with the newer Distributed scheduler
  (<xref alt="Dask developers, 2026" rid="ref-dask_dist" ref-type="bibr">Dask
  developers, 2026</xref>). While this incompatibility has since been
  resolved, the performance data in
  <xref alt="[fig_runtimes]" rid="fig_runtimes">[fig_runtimes]</xref>
  reflects the overhead inherent to the threaded scheduler. As shown,
  scheduling overhead dominates the runtime for lighter tasks. However,
  scenarios involving compute-intensive operations (high
  computation-to-chunk-size ratio) essentially mask this overhead,
  demonstrating that the package scales well when the scheduler is not
  the bottleneck.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the presented benchmarks represent a performance
  baseline. Since the Distributed scheduler is generally more performant
  and handles memory backpressure more effectively, users can expect
  performance to match or exceed these figures.</p>
  <p>A related limitation of the threaded scheduler is its
  prioritization of CPU utilization over memory constraints. Memory
  consumption is proportional to the number of cores multiplied by the
  data-chunk size. On systems with a high-core-count, this requires
  significant available memory. While reducing Dask’s target chunk size
  mitigates this, it increases the number of chunks and adds scheduling
  overhead.</p>
  <p>Importantly, Raster Tools is designed to be scheduler and
  configuration agnostic. It builds the computational graph but does not
  enforce a specific execution engine or set of configurations. This
  ensures that users retain full control over Dask configuration,
  including the ability to switch to the Distributed scheduler. It also
  means that Raster Tools will automatically benefit from future
  improvements in the Dask ecosystem.</p>

  <title>Comparison</title>
  <p>Except for cost-distance functions, Raster Tools provides a lazy,
  parallel, OOC, flexible, consistent, and chainable API, along with a
  suite of raster processing functions, and fully integrates with the
  wider Python data stack. This contrasts with other packages in the
  field like those listed above, which force a trade-off in one way or
  another, between these traits.</p>

<sec id="conclusion">
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Raster Tools fills the gaps in the Python ecosystem by simplifying
  raster and GIS workflows and reducing the need for boilerplate code.
  Its compatibility with widely used libraries and support for lazy, OOC
  operations make it easier for researchers to process large and complex
  datasets without reinventing common geospatial functions. By providing
  a unified API for raster analysis, Raster Tools accelerates the
  development of data pipelines and opens new opportunities for research
  projects that previously faced technical or resource limitations.
  Raster Tools has already proven valuable in real-world studies and
  operational contexts, and it continues to expand the possibilities for
  geospatial science and applied research.</p>
