  <title>Summary</title>
  <p><monospace>automesh</monospace> is an open-source Rust software
  program that uses a <bold>segmentation</bold>, typically generated
  from a 3D image stack, to create a finite element <bold>mesh</bold>,
  composed either of hexahedral (volumetric) or triangular (isosurface)
  elements. <monospace>automesh</monospace> <bold>converts</bold>

  <bold>defeature</bold> voxel domains, apply Laplacian and Taubin

  <p>This compendium of applications underscores the versatility and
  significance of 3D voxel data sets derived from CT and MRI as a
  fundamental ingredient of model development for patient-specific,
  site-specific, or as-built geometry. This concept is referred to as a
  <italic>digital twin</italic>. The geometric aspects of a digital twin
  involve image processing,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> and in
  particular, segmentation.</p>
  <p>Segmentation is the process of classifying each voxel in a data set
  as belonging to a specific class within the geometric domain,
  typically as a unique material, air, or void. We use a segmented 3D
  voxel data set as our start point. We seek to transform the voxel set
  into a finite element mesh suitable for numerical analysis, our end
  point.</p>
  <p>The most direct way to undertake this conversion is to create a
  one-to-one map from voxel to hexahedral element. This rudimentary
  approach, while attractive due to its effectiveness and simplicity,
  can result in billions to trillions of elements that can overwhelm
  current-day solvers, create massive input/output bottlenecks, and
  result in excessive consumption of digital storage resources.</p>
  <p>To achieve a more tractable number of elements, on the order of
  millions, <bold>downsampling</bold> of the original image data can be
  used to decrease the effective resolution, resulting in fewer voxels.
  Additionally, <bold>adaptivity</bold> of the finite element mesh,
  allowing non-uniform element sizes to span several length scales, can
  be used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="statement-of-need">
  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>Our endeavor to create a finite element mesh suitable for analysis
  from a segmentation has ten specific requirements. These requirements
  arise from the unique character of our mission space, collaborators,
  and sponsors. The first requirement comes from our start point. The
  next five requirements stem from our end point. The remaining four
  requirements follow from the workflow, converting a segmentation into
  a mesh.</p>
  <p>We list each of these requirements below:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <label>(1)</label>
      <p><bold>Segmentation start point.</bold> Many finite element mesh
      applications use geometric primitives (e.g., tessellations) or
      analytical geometry (e.g., splines, NURBS, isosurfaces) as a start
      point. In contrast, our start point is a segmentation composed of
      a 3D stack of voxels.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(2)</label>
      <p><bold>All-hex mesh.</bold> While tetrahedral finite elements
      offer excellent adaptivity characteristics, hexahedral finite
      elements offer superior performance characteristics. Moreover,
      higher-order tetrahedral elements, such as the 10-noded composite
      formulation, can result in a very large number of degrees of
      freedom, potentially overwhelming solver and serialization
      capabilities. In contrast, 8-noded hexahedral elements provide an
      economy of degrees of freedom and can be underintegrated to offer
      excellent performance with incompressible materials, so long as
      hourglass energy modes are monitored and controlled.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(3)</label>
      <p><bold>Multi-material.</bold> The mesh must be able to
      accommodate numerous materials throughout the domain. For example,
      mesh generation for microstructures that have prolific grain
      boundaries must be handled.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(4)</label>
      <p><bold>Multi-scale.</bold> The characteristic length scale of
      the features we seek to resolve can be significantly smaller than
      the length scales of the overall domain. Mesh adaptivity can be
      helpful to reconcile these differences of scale.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(5)</label>
      <p><bold>Quality.</bold> Elements must retain sufficient quality
      to ensure use with numerical computation. Common quality metrics
      include minimum scaled Jacobian, skew, edge ratio, and minimum
      angle. Poor element quality can lead to inaccurate results and
      convergence issues.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(6)</label>
      <p><bold>Input/Output Format.</bold> The segmentation input format
      must support both NumPy
      (<xref alt="NumPy Developers, 2025" rid="ref-numpy_format" ref-type="bibr">NumPy
      Developers, 2025</xref>) and SPN
      (<xref alt="Sandia National Laboratories, 2025" rid="ref-cubit_sandia" ref-type="bibr">Sandia
      National Laboratories, 2025</xref>). The mesh output must support
      both ExodusII

      (<xref alt="Dassault Systèmes, 2025" rid="ref-simulia_abaqus" ref-type="bibr">Dassault
      Systèmes, 2025</xref>).</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(7)</label>
      <p><bold>Automated.</bold> Creating finite element meshes from
      image stacks can be a time-consuming task, often representing the
      biggest bottleneck in an analyst’s workflow. The workflow from
      segmentation to mesh should be completely automated, without the
      need for human intervention.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(8)</label>
      <p><bold>Fast.</bold> The program must be as fast or faster than
      other available mesh generation software.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(9)</label>
      <p><bold>Open-source.</bold> All the source code must be freely
      available as open-source software.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <label>(10)</label>
      <p><bold>Professional.</bold> The application source code must
      reside on GitHub, Gitlab, or an equivalent platform, have a
      comprehensive test suite to assure quality and reproducibility,
      use continuous integration and continuous delivery principles
      (CI/CD), and be supported by the authors.</p>

  <p>One significant attribute of <monospace>automesh</monospace> is its
  implementation in Rust, a modern programming language known for its
  performance and memory safety. Rust’s ownership model prevents common
  programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer
  overflows, ensuring that <monospace>automesh</monospace> operates
  reliably and securely. Furthermore, Rust’s zero-cost abstractions
  allow <monospace>automesh</monospace> to deliver high performance
  without sacrificing code readability or maintainability. The
  language’s strong type system and concurrency features also enhance
  the robustness, making it well-suited for handling complex
  computational tasks efficiently
  (<xref alt="Klabnik &amp; Nichols, 2019" rid="ref-rust_programming_language" ref-type="bibr">Klabnik
  &amp; Nichols, 2019</xref>).</p>
  <p><monospace>automesh</monospace> is used via its command line
  interface. <monospace>automesh</monospace> directly converts voxels
  classified by a non-negative integer in the segmentation input file
  into a hexahedral finite element mesh. Segmented classes can be
  arbitrarily eliminated from the resultant mesh. For example, air or
  void surrounding a subject, often segmented with integer
  <monospace>0</monospace>, can be eliminated, which can significantly
  reduce the resultant mesh size and complexity.</p>
  <p><bold>Defeaturing</bold> is accomplished by specifying a voxel
  threshold. A cluster of voxels, defined as two or more voxels that
  share a face (edge and node sharing do not constitute a cluster) with
  count at or above the threshold will be preserved, whereas a cluster
  of voxels with a count below the threshold will be eliminated through
  resorption into the surrounding material. Figure 1 shows an example of
  a mesh before and after defeaturing.</p>

  1995</xref>) formulations for mesh <bold>smoothing</bold>, with
  optional hierarchical control. Hierarchical control classifies all
  nodes as prescribed, boundary, or interior. With hierarchical control,
  the updated (smoothed) position of a boundary node is influenced only
  by prescribed nodes and other boundary nodes; whereas, the updated
  position of an interior node is influenced by all types of nodes
  (prescribed, boundary, and interior). Smoothing with hierarchical
  control can help maintain domain boundaries better than smoothing
  alone

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p><monospace>automesh</monospace> presents a robust solution for
    automatic mesh generation from segmentation data, bridging the gap
    between 3D imaging modalities and finite element analysis. By
    leveraging defeaturing, smoothing, and an efficient octree
    structure, <monospace>automesh</monospace> not only enhances the
    quality of the generated meshes but also significantly reduces
    computational overhead. Its ability to handle multiple input and
    output formats, including support for both hexahedral and triangular
    elements, makes it versatile for various applications across
    engineering and biomedical fields. The integration of automated
    workflows ensures that users can efficiently convert complex voxel
    data into high-quality meshes without manual intervention.</p>
