  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Multidimensional data cubes are increasingly ubiquitous, in
  particular in the geosciences. Clustering techniques encompassing
  their full dimensionality are necessary to identify patterns “hidden”
  within these cubes. Clustering Geodata Cubes (CGC) is a Python package
  designed for partitional clustering, which identifies groups of
  similar data across two (e.g., spatial and temporal) or three (e.g.,
  spatial, temporal, and thematic) dimensions. CGC provides efficient
  and scalable co- and tri-clustering functionality appropriate to
  analyze both small and large datasets as well as a cluster refinement
  functionality that supports users in their quest to make sense of
  complex datasets.</p>

<sec id="introduction">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Faced with the increasing ubiquity of large datasets, data mining
  techniques have become essential to extracting patterns and generating
  insights. In this regard, clustering techniques, which aim to identify
  groups or subgroups with similar properties within a larger dataset,
  are becoming ever more popular.</p>
  <p>Traditional clustering techniques focus on a single dimension and
  may therefore obfuscate relevant groups
  (<xref alt="Cheng &amp; Church, 2000" rid="ref-ChengU003A2000" ref-type="bibr">Cheng
  &amp; Church, 2000</xref>;
  <xref alt="Hartigan, 1972" rid="ref-HartiganU003A1972" ref-type="bibr">Hartigan,
  1972</xref>). Hence, clustering techniques capable of simultaneously
  grouping data along multiple dimensions are needed. These techniques –
  referred to as co- or bi-clustering and tri-clustering in the case of
  two and three dimensions, respectively – have seen significant
  development and adoption in fields ranging from bioinformatics
  (<xref alt="Cheng &amp; Church, 2000" rid="ref-ChengU003A2000" ref-type="bibr">Cheng
  &amp; Church, 2000</xref>) to finance
  (<xref alt="Shi et al., 2018" rid="ref-ShiU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Shi
  et al., 2018</xref>) and natural language processing
  (<xref alt="Dhillon, 2001" rid="ref-DhillonU003A2001" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon,
  2001</xref>).</p>
  <p>The exponential growth of multidimensional data referring to
  geographical features (e.g., time series of satellite images) has
  resulted in a wide variety of geodata cubes, which can benefit from
  co- and tri-clustering. Indeed, following the development of a general
  information-theoretical approach
  (<xref alt="Dhillon et al., 2003" rid="ref-DhillonU003A2003" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon
  et al., 2003</xref>) to partitional co-clustering
  (<xref alt="Banerjee et al., 2007" rid="ref-BanerjeeU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee
  et al., 2007</xref>), Wu et al. presented an application of
  co-clustering to geodata
  (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2015" rid="ref-WuU003A2015" ref-type="bibr">Wu
  et al., 2015</xref>), as well as its extension to three dimensions
  (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2018" rid="ref-WuU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Wu
  et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>In light of the eminent employability of co- and tri-clustering
  approaches to geospatial disciplines like geo-information science and
  Earth observation, and the transferability to other (geo)scientific
  domains, this paper presents the Clustering Geodata Cubes (CGC)
  package. CGC provides efficient and scalable co- and tri-clustering
  methods to analyze both small and large datasets on single or multiple
  computing node systems. It also features a cluster refinement
  functionality that allows users to make sense of complex datasets more
  easily. An example of its application is the ongoing work on the
  analysis of spring onset datasets at high spatial resolution and
  continental scale, a preview of which is presented in the CGC
  tutorial. Although the package aims to meet the needs of geospatial
  data scientists, the algorithms implemented remain widely applicable
  and can easily be applied in other domains that require performing
  partitional clustering of positive data matrices.</p>

  <title>Statement of need</title>
  <p>The CGC package focuses on the needs of geospatial data scientists
  who require tools to make sense of multi-dimensional data cubes by
  providing the following features and functionalities:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Partitional co- and tri-clustering methods suitable for
      spatiotemporal (multi-dimensional) data.</bold> CGC includes
      clustering methods designed to simultaneously group elements into
      disjoint clusters along two or three dimensions. These methods are
      advantageous over one-dimensional clustering in that they provide
      a strategy to identify patterns that unfold across multiple
      dimensions, e.g. space and time. In addition, CGC provides
      functionality to refine the identified co- and tri-clusters. This
      post-processing step reduces the number of clusters to facilitate
      the identification and visualization of patterns.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Scalable clustering of small and big datasets.</bold> CGC
      offers functionality to efficiently utilize available
      computational resources (ranging from single machines to computing
      clusters) and to tackle a wide range of dataset sizes. For single
      machine execution the package offers optimized support of
      multi-core CPUs and/or limited system memory. For large datasets
      CGC supports the use of distributed data and computation on
      computing clusters</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Easy integration into geospatial analysis
      workflows.</bold> CGC is written in Python, which is widely used
      for geospatial scripting and applications, and employs NumPy

      types, guaranteeing seamless integration to the Python ecosystem
      and interoperability with the libraries prevalent in the field of
      big (geo)data. This furthermore ensures the interoperability of
      CGC with the Xarray package

    <title>Co-clustering</title>
    <p>CGC implements the Bregman block average co-clustering (BBAC)
    algorithm from Banerjee et al.
    (<xref alt="2007" rid="ref-BanerjeeU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>)
    as inspired by the MATLAB code of
    (<xref alt="Merugu &amp; Banerjee, 2004" rid="ref-MeruguU003A2004" ref-type="bibr">Merugu
    &amp; Banerjee, 2004</xref>). Briefly, the BBAC algorithm
    iteratively optimizes the clustering of rows and columns of a data
    matrix starting from a random initial assignment until convergence.
    The information loss from the original matrix to the clustered one,
    which is constructed as the matrix of the co-cluster means, is
    minimized using a loss function that is based on the I-divergence
    (<xref alt="Dhillon et al., 2003" rid="ref-DhillonU003A2003" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon
    et al., 2003</xref>;
    <xref alt="Kullback &amp; Leibler, 1951" rid="ref-KullbackU003A1951" ref-type="bibr">Kullback
    &amp; Leibler, 1951</xref>). CGC also supports a user-defined
    convergence threshold. To limit the influence of the initial
    conditions on the final clustering and to avoid local minima several
    runs are carried out, with the cluster assignments from the lowest
    loss function value ultimately being selected. Number of runs can be
    altered by the user.</p>
    <p>Note that in the CGC implementation of the algorithm, the update
    in the row- and column-cluster assignments is computed only from the
    previous iteration’s row and column. Contrarily to the original
    MATLAB implementation
    (<xref alt="Merugu &amp; Banerjee, 2004" rid="ref-MeruguU003A2004" ref-type="bibr">Merugu
    &amp; Banerjee, 2004</xref>), this makes the algorithm independent
    of the order in which the dimensions are considered, while still
    leading to an optimal clustering solution.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="tri-clustering">
    <title>Tri-clustering</title>
    <p>For tri-clustering CGC implements the so-called Bregman cube
    average tri-clustering (BCAT) algorithm, which is a generalization
    of the BBAC algorithm to three dimensions
    (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2018" rid="ref-WuU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Wu
    et al., 2018</xref>). The algorithmic implementation with respect to
    the loss function and the update schema are analogous to that
    described above for the co-clustering. Similarly, the tri-clustering
    outcome is independent of the order in which the three dimensions of
    the input array are provided.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="cluster-refinement">
    <title>Cluster refinement</title>
    <p>The CGC package implements an optional, secondary cluster
    refinement step based on the k-means method
    (<xref alt="Wu et al., 2016" rid="ref-WuU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Wu
    et al., 2016</xref>) and optimized using the Silhouette metric
    (<xref alt="Rousseeuw, 1987" rid="ref-RousseeuwU003A1987" ref-type="bibr">Rousseeuw,
    1987</xref>) as implemented in the scikit-learn package
    (<xref alt="Pedregosa et al., 2011" rid="ref-PedregosaU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa
    et al., 2011</xref>). This secondary grouping is based on
    statistical properties of the co- or tri-clusters (see the
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgc.readthedocs.io">package
    documentation</ext-link>) and helps to better capture patterns in
    the data by combining clusters and going beyond strict checkerboard
    structures.</p>
  </sec>

<sec id="related-software">
  <title>Related Software</title>
  <p>A number of co-/bi-clustering implementations based on different
  algorithms exist. While some of the available packages focus on
  specific applications, like gene expression data
  (<xref alt="Barkow et al., 2006" rid="ref-BarkowU003A2006" ref-type="bibr">Barkow
  et al., 2006</xref>;
  <xref alt="Eren et al., 2012" rid="ref-ErenU003A2012" ref-type="bibr">Eren
  et al., 2012</xref>), generic co-clustering tools include biclust (R)
  and CoClust (Python)
  (<xref alt="Role et al., 2019" rid="ref-RoleU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Role
  et al., 2019</xref>), as well as two implementations from the
  scikit-learn Python library
  (<xref alt="Pedregosa et al., 2011" rid="ref-PedregosaU003A2011" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa
  et al., 2011</xref>). Most of the available algorithms target tabular
  data with a hidden blocked-diagonal structure, where each row and
  column of the input matrix is assigned to only one co-cluster. In
  contrast, in spatio-temporal data a set of spatial elements often
  exhibits the same behaviour within multiple time windows and vice
  versa. This type of data requires algorithms where a subset taken
  along one dimension can be associated to multiple subsets taken along
  the other dimension. Partitioning algorithms of this type, such as the
  BBAC and BCAT algorithms implemented in CGC, can discover
  checkerboard-like patterns in the input data matrix. The package
  additionally enables the user to recover more of the intrinsic
  structure of the data in a second step, going beyond the limits on
  structure imposed</p>
  <p>Within the Python ecosystem, prominent implementations targeting
  checkerboard-like structures akin to CGC’s intial step are the
  scikit-learn SpectralBiclustering algorithm, which implements the
  method from
  (<xref alt="Kluger et al., 2003" rid="ref-KlugerU003A2003" ref-type="bibr">Kluger
  et al., 2003</xref>), and the CoclustInfo algorithm from CoClust, also
  based on information-theoretic co-clustering
  (<xref alt="Dhillon et al., 2003" rid="ref-DhillonU003A2003" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon
  et al., 2003</xref>;
  <xref alt="Govaert &amp; Nadif, 2018" rid="ref-GovaertU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Govaert
  &amp; Nadif, 2018</xref>). However, both approaches differ from CGC in
  the field of applicability. Spectral methods like the former are fast,
  but their accuracy has been shown to be limited
  (<xref alt="Ailem et al., 2015" rid="ref-AilemU003A2015" ref-type="bibr">Ailem
  et al., 2015</xref>;
  <xref alt="Role et al., 2019" rid="ref-RoleU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Role
  et al., 2019</xref>). The latter focuses on datasets representing
  joint-probability distributions, preserving statistics other than the
  co-cluster average (the row and column averages) in the search for the
  optimal clustering solution
  (<xref alt="Banerjee et al., 2007" rid="ref-BanerjeeU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee
  et al., 2007</xref>). This requirement does not generally apply to the
  geospatial datasets which CGC is targeting. Neither, however, offers
  the ability to “break out” of the algorithmically-imposed checkerboard
  pattern.</p>
  <p>Finally, to the best of our knowledge, CGC is unique in being
  designed from the outset for use with big data (e.g. by including an
  implementation that supports multi-node distributed computing), being
  able to analyze more complex data cubes via tri-clustering, and being
  able to perform secondary cluster refinement.</p>

  et al., 2016</xref>)) that illustrates how to perform cluster analysis
  of geospatial datasets using CGC. Notebooks are made directly
  available via a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/tutorial-cgc">dedicated
  GitHub repository</ext-link>, and are also published as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgc-tutorial.readthedocs.io">static
  web pages</ext-link> for reference and linked to the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgc.readthedocs.io">CGC
  documentation</ext-link> via a ‘Tutorials’ tab. The tutorials are
  designed to run on systems with limited CPU/memory capacity, which,
  together with environment requirement specifications in a standardized
  format (<monospace>conda</monospace> YAML file) and binder badges,
  give users the possibility to easily run the notebooks live on
  <monospace>mybinder.org</monospace>
  (<xref alt="Jupyter Project et al., 2018" rid="ref-JupyterU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Jupyter
  Project et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>Tutorials cover the following topics:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Co- and tri-cluster analysis.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>K-means-based cluster refinement.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Choice of the suitable implementation for a given problem
      size/infrastructure available.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Loading of geospatial data, common data-manipulation tasks in a
      workflow involving CGC, visualization of the output.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Note that while the tutorial is aimed at geospatial uses cases, it
  illustrates some real-case applications that are likely to make it
  easier for users to carry out cluster analysis using CGC in other
  fields as well.</p>

  <p>All co-authors contributed to the conceptualization of the work,
  which was led by R.Z.M. and E.I.V.. F.N., M.W.G., and O.K. prepared
  the first draft of the tutorials, and wrote the initial draft of this
  manuscript. F.N. suggested changes to the co- and tri-clustering
  algorithms. R.Z.M., E.I.V., and S.G. led the design of experiments to
  test and improve the CGC package. R.Z.M. and E.I.V. helped to improve
  the tutorials. S.G. provided the required computational resources to
  run the experiments and tutorials and made suggestions for code
  optimizations. All co-authors reviewed and edited the final
