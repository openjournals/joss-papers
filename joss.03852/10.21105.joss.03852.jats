  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Effective management of limited water resources is challenging
  because of competing interests and rapid development have resulted in
  increased demands for water

  &amp; Hoekstra, 2016</xref>). Understanding interactions among the
  different components of a hydrologic system, often supported by
  physics-based models, is important information for water resources
  planning and management. For example, groundwater models often serve
  as a tool for exploring the impacts of different water management and
  conservation scenarios
  (<xref alt="Davie &amp; Quinn, 2019" rid="ref-DavieU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Davie
  &amp; Quinn, 2019</xref>). The traditional groundwater modeling
  approach has mainly focused on simulating flow and storage in aquifers
  that have simplified boundary conditions to represent exchanges with
  surface water

  hydraulically connected surface water and groundwater systems by
  applying simple and loosely coupled boundary conditions within
  hydrologic models is no longer adequate to address water management
  issues
  (<xref alt="Fatichi et al., 2016" rid="ref-FatichiU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Fatichi
  et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, integrated hydrologic models (IHMs)
  that couple governing equations for surface-water and groundwater flow
  are necessary to represent water resources that are impacted by
  changes in climate and increases in withdrawals and consumption of
  water.</p>
  <p>GSFLOW is an IHM
  (<xref alt="Markstrom et al., 2008" rid="ref-MarkstromU003A2008" ref-type="bibr">Markstrom

  between the two systems. Because modelers are moving toward simulating
  the hydrologic cycle in greater detail, larger datasets from multiple
  sources are used to parameterize these models. Beyond the scope of
  example problems, most applied problems require custom workflows and
  code to process large datasets related to model inputs and outputs.
  Scripting languages like Python make it easier to process large data
  sets and provide standard methods that can be used for developing,
  editing, and properly formatting model input files and for analyzing
  model output data. These developments have led to major advancements
  in model reproducibility and improvements in model applicability

  <p>GSFLOW model development has previously been a piecemeal approach.
  Arcpy-GSFLOW scripts
  (<xref alt="Gardner et al., 2018" rid="ref-GardnerU003A2018" ref-type="bibr">Gardner
  et al., 2018</xref>) or GSFLOW-GRASS packages have been used to
  process surface-water input data into model files. PRMS-Python
  (<xref alt="Volk &amp; Turner, 2019" rid="ref-VolkU003A2019" ref-type="bibr">Volk
  &amp; Turner, 2019</xref>) could be used to edit most of the PRMS
  inputs to GSFLOW. Finally, FloPy
  (<xref alt="Bakker et al., 2016" rid="ref-BakkerU003A2016" ref-type="bibr">Bakker
  et al., 2016</xref>,
  <xref alt="2021" rid="ref-BakkerU003A2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
  could be used to edit most of the MODFLOW inputs to GSFLOW. This
  approach is not tightly coupled and still requires manual edits and
  additional external scripts to edit, run models, and process output
  data. Because of the complexity of IHMs and the need for model
  reproducibility, a single integrated scripting package will help
  standardize and streamline model development and calibration.</p>

  relies on FloPy model and package objects and interfaces with these
  features to provide FloPy users with familiar code syntax and to
  ensure the long-term maintainability of the code base.</p>
  <p>The pyGSFLOW package was developed for hydrologic modelers and
  researchers who are developing, calibrating, or applying models as
  part of their scientific investigation (e.g., prediction scenarios,
  stream capture) with GSFLOW. The code base currently is being used for
  the development of several river-basin scale hydrologic models in
  western basins, including the example shown below highlighting
  application to the Russian River basin and the Santa Rosa Plain
  Watershed (figure 1)

  <p>The Santa Rosa Plain (SRP) model
  (<xref alt="Woolfenden &amp; Nishikawa, 2014" rid="ref-WoolfendenU003A2014" ref-type="bibr">Woolfenden
  &amp; Nishikawa, 2014</xref>) is an IHM that was developed as a tool
  to provide scientific information to water managers about future
  climate change scenarios. The SRP model applied four global-climate
  models and simulated relative change in groundwater storage and
  availability under each scenario. Prior to simulating future change,
  the model was calibrated to historical groundwater and surface-water
  conditions. Part of the calibration process involves identifying
  sensitive and insensitive parameters. Calibration and sensitivity
  analysis experiments on model parameters can provide insight into
  reducing model error when predicting results such as simulated
  streamflow (figure 1). Daily streamflow data from National Water
  Information System (NWIS) site 11466800
  (<xref alt="U.S. Geological Survey, 2022" rid="ref-USGSU003A2022" ref-type="bibr">U.S.
  Geological Survey, 2022</xref>) provided observations for this
  experiment. Twenty-one iterations of the SRP model were run in series
  with pyGSFLOW to test the sensitivity of the snarea_curve (snow
  depletion curve), ssr2gw_rate (gravity reservoir to groundwater
  reservior routing coeficient), and gsflow_coef (linear groundwater
  discharge equation coeficient) with a simple “for loop.” The
  ssr2gw_rate was identified as a much more sensitive parameter to model
  calibration than the snarea_curve and gsflow_coef parameters (figure
  1). Insights like these allow researchers to focus their calibration
  efforts on the most sensitive parameters and fix insensitive
  parameters, thus reducing the time and complexity of the calibration
  process. Although actual calibration generally is not done directly
  with pyGSFLOW, it provides an easy to use interface to update
  parameters based on grid cell location or parameter zone that can be
  used for complex operations in conjuction with external calibration
  software.</p>

  <p>The pyGSFLOW package also includes features to visualize input and
  output data spatially using Matplotlib
  (<xref alt="Hunter, 2007" rid="ref-HunterU003A2007" ref-type="bibr">Hunter,
  2007</xref>) plots and by exporting datasets to shapefile or the
  visualization toolkit (VTK) format
  (<xref alt="Schroeder et al., 2006" rid="ref-SchroederU003A2006" ref-type="bibr">Schroeder
  et al., 2006</xref>). By providing pyGSFLOW a shapefile or list of
  hydrologic response unit (HRU) geometries, the code is able to plot
  arrays and contour arrays of unique parameter values and is fully
  compatible with the FloPy plotting routines for MODFLOW. PRMS input
  parameter values can be layered over MODFLOW output and can
  potentially help identify trends and sensitive parameters controlling
  those trends in streamflow, recharge, and groundwater levels
  throughout the model. The ssr2gw_rate parameter, which scales the
  exchange between the PRMS gravity reservoir and the MODFLOW
  groundwater reservior in GSFLOW, can then be overlain on top of
  recharge arrays to inspect the input and output for correlated trends
  (figure 2). Figure 2 shows that in the western part of the basin, both
  the ssr2gw_rate and the relative amount of areal recharge is slightly
  greater than the eastern part of the basin. The simulated recharge
  data also show the highest volume of recharge occurs along a few short
  losing stream sections. These insights can help the researcher adjust
  input parameters for both streamflow and groundwater level
  calibration.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>GSFLOW IHMs simulate complex processes and interactions between
  surface-water and groundwater flow systems. Parameterizing these model
  processes requires large datasets from multiple sources to represent
  the hydrologic cycle. Previous approaches involved multiple
  disconnected scripts and packages, some of which rely on proprietary
  code, which makes reproducibility difficult. pyGSFLOW is a tightly
  coupled software package, that allows the user to import all parts of
  their model in one script, which helps to standardize and streamline
  model development, calibration, and output analysis.</p>
